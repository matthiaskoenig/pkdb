        "description": "Sixteen healthy adult males participated in this study after internal review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. The mean (± standard deviation) age was 27.1 ± 3.1 years, and the weight was 76.7 ± 6.8 kg. Volunteers were excluded on the basis of the following criteria: prior hypersensitivity to quinolones, smoking, the use of medication for chronic illness, body weight deviating by more than 15% from ideal weight, and abnormalities on physical examination, electrocardiogram, or prestudy laboratory tests. Each volunteer was given a list of xanthine-containing products and instructed to abstain from such items, alcohol, and all other drugs beginning 2 days prior to study participation. A xanthine-free diet was maintained throughout the study.",

Subjects ingested lomefloxacin, placebo, and caffeine doses with 180 ml of distilled water.
