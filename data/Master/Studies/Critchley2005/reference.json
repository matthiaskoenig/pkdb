    "abstract": "Chinese subjects show more rapid absorption of paracetamol, a tendency to produce less glucuronide but more sulphate conjugates and reduced production of cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates. The latter may help to protect against hepatotoxicity following paracetamol overdose.",
