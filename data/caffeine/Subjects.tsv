Subjects were admitted to the Antibiotic Research Unit of the Biopharmaceutics and Pharmacokinetics Center, School of Pharmacy, after internal review board approval and informed written consent were obtained. The mean ± standard deviation age, weight, and serum creatinine of the subjects were 26.7 ± 1.6 years, 76.3 ± 8.6 kg, and 1.0 ± 0.1 mg/dl, respectively. Exclusion criteria included prior hypersensitivity to any drug and the use of medication for chronic illness. Each volunteer was given a list of xanthine-containing products and instructed to abstain from all such items, alcohol, and all other drugs beginning 3.5 days prior to participation in the study. A xanthine-free diet was maintained throughout the study. Subjects fasted for 12 h before and 4 h after both doses of caffeine and after the first and last doses of ciprofloxacin.
