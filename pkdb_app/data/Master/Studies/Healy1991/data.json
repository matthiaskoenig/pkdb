    "abstract": "Sixteen healthy, nonsmoking adult males participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study to evaluate the influence of chronic lomefloxacin administration on the disposition of caffeine and its major metabolite, paraxanthine, at steady-state conditions. Lomefloxacin (400 mg) or placebo was administered orally once daily for 5 days to xanthine-free volunteers after an overnight fast. Caffeine (200 mg orally) was administered simultaneously with lomefloxacin on days 3 through 5. After a 2-day washout period, subjects were crossed over to the alternate 5-day regimen with caffeine, which was again given on the final 3 days. Blood samples for caffeine, paraxanthine, and lomefloxacin concentration determinations were serially collected for 48 h following the last dose of each regimen. All compounds were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. For the placebo versus lomefloxacin-containing treatments, maximum caffeine concentrations in plasma (4.35 +/- 0.63 versus 4.07 +/- 0.56 micrograms/ml), areas under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 h at steady state (30.3 +/- 6.9 versus 29.7 +/- 6.6 micrograms.h/ml), and elimination half-lives of caffeine (4.8 +/- 1.1 versus 4.8 +/- 1.2 h) were not significantly different. In addition, there were no significant changes in the disposition parameters of paraxanthine as a result of lomefloxacin administration. The frequencies of central nervous system-related effects for the two treatments were not statistically different. We conclude that lomefloxacin has no significant effect on the disposition of caffeine in young healthy volunteers.",

The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) age was 27.1 \u00b1 3.1 years, and the weight was 76.7 \u00b1 6.8 kg. Volunteers were excluded on the basis of the following criteria: prior hypersensitivity to quinolones, smoking, the use of medication for chronic illness, body weight deviating by more than 15% from ideal weight, and abnormalities on physical examination, electrocardiogram, or prestudy laboratory tests. Each volunteer was given a list of xanthine-containing products and instructed to abstain from such items, alcohol, and all other drugs beginning 2 days prior to study participation. A xanthine-free diet was maintained throughout the study.",
