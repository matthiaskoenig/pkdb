23	Fuhr1993a	D1	caffeine	oral	single dose		167.0	mg	no	0	h	Following an overnight period of methylxanthine abstinence the subjects received 167 mg of caffeine in the morning administered as 5.0 g of instant coffee (Nescafe Classic) in both study periods. In addition, the subjects drank 300 ml of either grapefruit juice or water 0.5 h before and every 6 h following caffeine intake until the end of the sampling period. In order to exclude any contamination that might be present in commercially processed grapefruit juice, only the freshly pressed juice from 'Outspan' fruit of South African origin was administered. The naringin content determined by h.p.l.c. (Greiner & Wallrauch, 1984) in two fruits of the batch used was 530 and 421 mg 1-1.
