All subjects were nonsmokers based upon self-reports.Four of the participants were regular users of caffeine in the form of coffee or other caffeine-containing beverages. All subjects were asked to abstain from all caffeine-containing foods and beverages for 24 h prior to each study trial. The study had a randomized, four-way crossover design, with at least 7 days elapsing between treatments.",
