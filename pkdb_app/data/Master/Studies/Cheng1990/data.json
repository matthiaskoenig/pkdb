            "description": "13 healthy volunteers (nine men and four women on the hospital staff) were recruited. The volunteers were between 20 and 50 years of age and weighed between 47 and 85 kg. None were taking any medications, and all had normal plasma biochemical profiles. Their normal caffeine intake ranged between 0 and 250 mg / day. Except for one volunteer who smoked 10 cigarettes a day, all others were nonsmokers. Eight of the volunteers were nondrinkers, and the other five consumed less than 50 gm alcohol a day. They were not restricted in their normal activities until the day before the study, when they were instructed to abstain from caffeine. Six of the same group of healthy subjects also received at least two doses (70 mg and 200 mg) of intravenous caffeine on another two separate occasions for estimation of the bioavailability of orally administered caffeine in these subjects. Three of these same healthy subjects also received 300 mg caffeine by intravenous infusion over 20 minutes.",

    "title": "Dose-dependent pharmacokinetics of caffeine in humans: relevance as a test of quantitative liver function.",
    "abstract": "Caffeine clearance was determined in 13 healthy control subjects and in 13 patients with histologically proven cirrhosis. On separate occasions, 70 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg single doses of anhydrous caffeine were administered orally with decaffeinated coffee to each subject. Subjects were analyzed individually, acting as their own controls, thus reducing interindividual variability. The present study showed that caffeine exhibited dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, particularly in subjects who showed high initial clearance with the low dose (70 mg) of caffeine. There was a significant decrease in caffeine clearance with increasing dose from 70 mg to 300 mg (n = 26, p less than 0.01, Dunnett's test), indicating saturable caffeine metabolism in the dose range tested. These findings imply that if caffeine is to be used as a guide to deteriorating liver function, serial caffeine clearance estimations should be performed in each individual subject, with use of the same dose of caffeine each time.",
