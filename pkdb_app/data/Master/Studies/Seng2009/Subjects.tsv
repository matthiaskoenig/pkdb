(coffee or tea) containing <=200 mg of caffeine per day, and a regular caffeine consumer to one who consumed more >200 mg. A cup (150 mL) of coffee or tea is equivalent to approximately a caffeine dose of 70 and 25 mg respectively (9). Additionally, a non-smoker refers to an individual who did not smoke for at least 6 months prior to dosing.
