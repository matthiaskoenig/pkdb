One group consisted of women taking a low-dose oestrogen (50 \u00b5g or less of the oestrogen component) oral contraceptive steroid for at least 3 months and no other medication (OCS group). The other group comprised 9 women of similar age not taking any medication. In each group 8 women were Caucasian, and t was Black. History, physical and laboratory examination indicated that all subjects were in good health. All subjects were asked to abstain from caffeine consumption 48 hours prior to the study.",
