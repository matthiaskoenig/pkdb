Abernethy1985	oral contraceptive (OC)	oc	"The effect of chronic (> 3 months) administration of low-dose oestrogen-containing (< 50 µg oestrogen) oral contraceptives (OCS) on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine has been examined in a treated females matched with 9 non-smoking, drugfree, healthy control females of similar age, weight and ethnic origin. Each subject received 162mg caffeine base orally after an overnight fast.
All subjects were asked to abstain from caffeine consumption 48h prior to the study."

Benowitz2003	smoking	smoking	Twelve cigarette smokers were studied in 3 treatment conditions, each lasting 7 days, during which they smoked cigarettes, breathed carbon monoxide to achieve carboxyhemoglobin levels similar to those associated with cigarette smoking, chlorzoxazone (250 mg) and caffeine (250 mg) with measurement of disposition kinetics and urine metabolite profiles.

Culm-Merdek2005	placebo + caffeine	control	effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmaconkinetics for caffeine and its metabolites; Seven healthy subjects received single 250 mg doses of caffeine (or matching placebo) together with fluvoxamine (four doses of 100 mg over 2 days) or with matching placebo in a double-blind, four-way crossover study. For 24 h after caffeine or placebo administration, plasma caffeine and fluvoxamine concentrations were determined. Psychomotor performance, sedation, and electroencephalographic (EEG) ‘beta’ frequency activity were also assessed.
