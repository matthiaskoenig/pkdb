      How to search data in PK-DB?
    </v-card-title>
    <v-card-text>
      <p>
        Data in PK-DB is represented as entries, with every single <code>Entry</code> having information
        on the
      <ul>
        <li>Study in which it was recorded,</li>
        <li>Individual or Group it was measured on,</li>
        <li>Intervention or Interventions which were applied,</li>
        <li>and the Output or Timecourse which was measured.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The resulting data entry has the form<br/>
        <code>Entry(study, group/individual, intervention(s), output/timecourse)</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        To filter database entries filters can be applied individually or in combination on Studies, Groups/Individuals,
        Interventions, Outputs/Timecourses. To apply a filter on one of the categories select the search form and start
        typing. The available options for the query are displayed. When moving the mouse over an option the
        description of the respective information is shown.
        The search examples below show some typical filter queries.
      </p>
      <p>
        By clicking on results after searching the results detail view is shown which allows exploration of the results.
        Results can be downloaded by clicking on the download button.
