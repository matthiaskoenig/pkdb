  abstract    = {The pharmacokinetics of caffeine and its dimethylxanthine metabolites were evaluated in Nigerians, for whom it is normal to consume caffeine-containing beverages during ill health and recuperation in the belief that caffeine aids early recovery from illness; however, there are no data defining the kinetics of caffeine in healthy and ill Nigerians.A single oral dose of 300 mg caffeine was given to ten healthy adult Nigerians and ten adults suffering from acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection. Caffeine and its dimethylxanthine metabolites were measured in plasma and saliva of healthy subjects and in plasma of patients suffering from malaria using high-performance liquid chromatography.The plasma pharmacokinetics of caffeine per se in both groups was similar (P > 0.05). The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of paraxanthine was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in malaria (0.9 +/- 0.4 microg/ ml) than in healthy controls (1.4 +/- 0.5 microg/ml), and the paraxanthine:caffeine area under the plasma concentration time curve ratio, an index of cytochrome P450 (CYP)IA2 activity was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in malaria patients (0.5 +/- 0.1) than in healthy controls (0.3 +/- 0.2). The elimination half-life of theophylline was longer in malaria, while the area under the plasma concentration time curve of theobromine was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in malaria (7.1 +/- 3.4 microg ml(-1) h) than in healthy adults (4.1 +/- 2.2 microg ml(-1) h). Excellent correlations were found between saliva and plasma concentrations of caffeine (r2 = 0.98) with a mean saliva:plasma concentrations ratio of 0.7 +/- 0.1. The plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC) were therefore higher than the corresponding salivary levels, so that the apparent oral clearance calculated for saliva exceeded the true oral clearance based on plasma data.Acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria produced significant changes in the disposition of caffeine metabolites. Analysis of concentrations in saliva is a useful non-invasive method for monitoring the kinetics of caffeine and paraxanthine in Nigerians.},

A correct estimation of the relative magnitudes of intra-individual and inter-individual variations in caffeine elimination is significant for the use of the elimination parameter of caffeine to characterize the biotransformation capacity of a specific form of cytochrome P-450 (1AII) in vivo. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the magnitudes of fluctuation of caffeine-clearance and half-life as well as inter- and intra-individual comparison in 12 healthy male subjects. Compared to the high reproducibility of caffeine decay curves in each healthy male, caffeine elimination varied more extensively between subjects. The distribution of variance amounted to: intra-individual 21.4\%, inter-individual 78.6\%. The knowledge of variance provided precise evidence of the sample size, which is necessary to prove previously defined differences.},

  abstract    = {Theophylline (dimethylxanthine) has been used to treat airway diseases for more than 80 years. It was originally used as a bronchodilator, but the relatively high doses required are associated with frequent side effects, so its use declined as inhaled β2-agonists became more widely used. More recently it has been shown to have antiinflammatory effects in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at lower concentrations. The molecular mechanism of bronchodilatation is inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE)3, but the antiinflammatory effect may be due to inhibition of PDE4 and histone deacetylase-2 activation, resulting in switching off of activated inflammatory genes. Through this mechanism, theophylline also reverses corticosteroid resistance, and this may be of particular value in severe asthma and COPD, wherein histone deacetylase-2 activity is reduced. Theophylline is given systemically (orally as slow-release preparations for chronic treatment and intravenously for acute exacerbations of asthma). Efficacy is related to blood concentrations, which are determined mainly by hepatic metabolism, which may be increased or decreased in several diseases and by concomitant drug therapy. Theophylline is now usually used as an add-on therapy in patients with asthma not well controlled on inhaled corticosteroids with or without long-acting β2-agonists and in patients with COPD with severe disease not controlled by bronchodilator therapy. Side effects are related to plasma concentrations and include nausea, vomiting, and headaches due to PDE inhibition and at higher concentrations to cardiac arrhythmias and seizures due to adenosine A1-receptor antagonism. In the future, low-dose theophylline may be useful in reversing corticosteroid resistance in COPD and severe asthma.},

Spot urine samples were analyzed 6 h after 200 mg caffeine consumption, following a 30 h methylxantine-free diet. The major urinary caffeine metabolites are 1-methyluric acid (1U), 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil (AFMU), 1-methylxanthine (1X), 1,7-dimethyluric acid (17U) and 1,7-dimethylxanthine (17X). CYP1A2, CYP2A6, XO and NAT-2 activities were estimated from the metabolic ratios (AFMU + 1U + 1X)/17U, 17U/17X, 1U/(1X + 1U) and AFMU/(AFMU + 1U + 1X), respectively. Metabolites and internal standard were extracted with chloroform/isopropanol (85:15, v/v) and separated on a C18 column by an isocratic HPLC system using a two-step elution with manual switch from solvent A (0.1\% acetic acid-methanol-acetonitrile, 92:4:5 v/v) to solvent B (0.1\% acetic acid-methanol, 60:40, v/v), and detected at 280 nm. The method exhibited adequate metabolite separation (resolution factors >1.48), accuracy (94.1-106.3\%) and intraday and interday precision <8.02 and <8.78\%, respectively (n = 6). Smoking affected only CYP1A2, whereas gender had no effect in any enzyme activity. NAT-2 exhibited bimodal distribution, 63.6\% of volunteers being slow acetylators. The developed RP-HPLC method was fully validated and successfully applied for the evaluation of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, XO and NAT-2 activities.},

Both caffeine and paraxanthine competitively and nonselectively inhibit adenosine receptors in vitro. To examine the contribution of paraxanthine to the pharmacologic activity of caffeine, we administered to 12 subjects in a crossover design oral caffeine (2 or 4 mg/kg) versus placebo or oral paraxanthine (same dose as caffeine) versus placebo, each after 3 days of methylxanthine abstinence. Both caffeine and paraxanthine significantly increased diastolic blood pressure, plasma epinephrine levels, and free fatty acids. Caffeine and paraxanthine produced a similar magnitude of response at 4 mg/kg; however, caffeine appeared to produce greater responses than paraxanthine at 2 mg/kg. Caffeine and paraxanthine have similar sympathomimetic actions. The activity of paraxanthine needs to be considered in understanding the clinical pharmacology of caffeine, particularly with chronic, repetitive caffeine consumption.},

Furthermore, the tolerability of these probe drugs, both alone and in combination as a cocktail was assessed.Twelve healthy volunteer subjects (age range 22-48 years) were entered into an open, fixed sequence, 6-limb, single centre study. The randomization was such that all drugs were given individually followed by the full "cocktail" as the last treatment limb. The phenotypic index used to assess the intrinsic activity of the CYP isoforms included metabolite/parent ratios in plasma and urine (CYPs 1A2, 2E1 & 2C9), parent/metabolite ratios in urine (CYP2D6) and plasma AUClast (CYP3A4). Blood pressure and blood glucose measurements were used to assess pharmacodynamic interactions. Tolerability was assessed through reporting of adverse eventsOverall, there was little evidence that the probe drugs interacted metabolically when co-administered as the cocktail. The ratio of the geometric mean (and 90\% confidence interval) of the phenotypic index, obtained after administration of the probe as part of the cocktail and when given alone were: caffeine, 0.86 (0.67-1.10), midazolam, 0.96 (0.74-1.24), tolbutamide, 0.86 (0.72-1.03), debrisoquine 1.04 (0.97-1.12) and chlorzoxazone, 0.95 (0.86-1.05). There was no difference in blood pressure and blood glucose concentrations following the cocktail and dosing of the individual probes. There was no effect on ECG recordings at any time-point. The adverse events reported for individual drug administrations were mild, transient and expected. Overall no more adverse events were reported on the cocktail study days than on the days when the drugs were administered alone.The five probe drugs when coadministered, in this dosing regimen, demonstrated no evidence of either a metabolic or pharmacodynamic interaction that might confound the conclusions drawn during a cocktail study. The present cocktail methodology has the potential to become a useful tool to aid the detection of clinically important drug-drug interactions during drug development.},

  abstract =    {Aromatic amines are well known as occupational carcinogens and are found in cooked foods, tobacco smoke, synthetic fuels, and agricultural chemicals. For the primary arylamines, metabolic N-oxidation by hepatic cytochromes P-450 is generally regarded as an initial activation step leading to carcinogenesis. The metabolic activation of 4-aminobiphenyl, 2-naphthylamine, and several heterocyclic amines has been shown recently to be catalyzed by rat cytochrome P-450ISF-G and by its human ortholog, cytochrome P-450PA. We now report that human hepatic microsomal caffeine 3-demethylation, the initial major step in caffeine biotransformation in humans, is selectively catalyzed by cytochrome P-450PA. Caffeine 3-demethylation was highly correlated with 4-aminobiphenyl N-oxidation (r = 0.99; P less than 0.0005) in hepatic microsomal preparations obtained from 22 human organ donors, and both activities were similarly decreased by the selective inhibitor, 7,8-benzoflavone. The rates of microsomal caffeine 3-demethylation, 4-aminobiphenyl N-oxidation, and phenacetin O-deethylation were also significantly correlated with each other and with the levels of immunoreactive human cytochrome P-450PA. Moreover, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to human cytochrome P-450PA was shown to inhibit strongly all three of these activities and to inhibit the N-oxidation of the carcinogen 2-naphthylamine and the heterocyclic amines, 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido-[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]-quinoline. Human liver cytochrome P-450PA was also shown to catalyze caffeine 3-demethylation, 4-aminobiphenyl N-oxidation, and phenacetin O-deethylation. Thus, estimation of caffeine 3-demethylation activity in humans may be useful in the characterization of arylamine N-oxidation phenotypes and in the assessment of whether or not the hepatic levels of cytochrome P-450PA, as affected by environmental or genetic factors, contribute to interindividual differences in susceptibility to arylamine-induced cancers.},

  abstract =    {The wide variations in urinary bladder and colo-rectal cancer incidence in humans have been attributed in part to metabolic factors associated with exposure to carcinogenic aromatic and heterocyclic amines. Cytochrome P-4501A2 (CYP1A2), which catalyses N-oxidation, and acetyltransferase (NAT2) which catalyses N- and O-acetylation, both appear to be polymorphically distributed in human populations; and slow and rapid NAT2 phenotypes have been implicated as risk factors for these cancers. Caffeine has also been shown to undergo 3-demethylation by CYP1A2, and it is further acetylated to 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil (AFMU) by the polymorphic NAT2. In this report, we describe a metabolic phenotyping procedure that can be used to determine concomitantly the hepatic CYP1A2 and NAT2 phenotypes. For the NAT2 phenotype, we confirm the valid use of the urinary molar ratio of AFMU/1-methylxanthine, even in alkaline urines. For the CYP1A2 phenotype, the urinary molar ratio of [1,7-dimethylxanthine + 1,7-dimethyluric acid]/caffeine, taken at 4-5 h after caffeine ingestion, was identified from pharmacokinetic analyses of 12 subjects as being better correlated (r = 0.73; p = 0.007) with the rate constant for caffeine 3-demethylation than other previously suggested ratios. This procedure was then used to determine the CYP1A2 phenotype in subjects from Arkansas (n = 101), Italy (n = 95), and China (n = 78). Statistical and probit analyses of nonsmokers indicated that the CYP1A2 activity was not normally distributed and appeared trimodal. This trimodality allowed arbitrary designation of slow, intermediate, and rapid phenotypes, which ranged from 12-13\% slow, 51-67\% intermediate, and 20-37\% rapid, in the different populations. A reproducibility study of 13 subjects over a 5 day or 5 week period showed that, with one exception, intraindividual variability did not alter this CYP1A2 phenotypic classification. Induction of CYP1A2 by cigarette smoking was also confirmed by the increased caffeine metabolite ratios observed in the Arkansas and Italian smokers (blonde tobacco).

Furthermore, probit analyses of Arkansas and Italian blonde tobacco smokers could not discriminate between phenotypes, apparently as a consequence of enzyme induction.},

  abstract    = {The microsomal metabolism of caffeine and its primary dimethylxanthine metabolites, paraxanthine, theophylline, and theobromine, was investigated in 15 different human livers, including those from two known nonsmokers and one known smoker. At least two distinct enzymes with differing substrate affinities have the potential to catalyze most methylxanthine N-demethylations and C8-hydroxylations in vitro; however, at the low methylxanthine concentrations routinely encountered in vivo, participation by the high affinity site is expected to predominate. It appears that the high affinity enzyme is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-inducible isozyme of cytochrome P-450, based on competitive inhibition by 7-ethoxyresorufin and benzo[a]pyrene, and based on a significant (p less than 0.001) correlation between 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation and methylxanthine demethylation rates. alpha-Naphthoflavone inhibited all methylxanthine demethylations in excess of 80\% in two high activity livers, whereas 8-hydroxylations were generally inhibited less. Kinetic analysis of paraxanthine 7-demethylation in four different liver preparations resulted in similar Km values of 1.2 +/- 0.5 mM (mean +/- SD), whereas Vmax values varied 8-fold, compatible with participation by the same high affinity isozyme. Notable was the high degree of inter-liver variation in metabolic rates, with the known smoker showing the second highest activity among a 20-fold range in paraxanthine demethylation rates, consistent with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-related enzyme induction. Maximal inhibition of paraxanthine 8-hydroxylation by alpha-naphthoflavone left similar residual activities in the 15 liver preparations, indicating the presence of an enzyme activity that was not inducible. Furthermore, in low activity livers, more than 80\% of paraxanthine 8-hydroxylation was mediated by an isozyme of cytochrome P-450 insensitive to inhibition by alpha-naphthoflavone. Our in vitro data show that the proportion of demethylation relative to hydroxylation products of paraxanthine correlate with 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation rates. Taken together, the data provide a rationale for a potential in vivo marker of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-inducible cytochrome P-450 activity based on a urinary metabolite ratio of paraxanthine 7-demethylation to 8-hydroxylation products after caffeine intake.},

  abstract    = {Caffeine from dietary sources (mainly coffee, tea and soft drinks) is the most frequently and widely consumed CNS stimulant in the world today. Because of its enormous popularity, the consumption of caffeine is generally thought to be safe and long term caffeine intake may be disregarded as a medical problem. However, it is clear that this compound has many of the features usually associated with a drug of abuse. Furthermore, physicians should be aware of the possible contribution of dietary caffeine to the presenting signs and symptoms of patients. The toxic effects of caffeine are extensions of their pharmacological effects. The most serious caffeine-related CNS effects include seizures and delirium. Other symptoms affecting the cardiovascular system range from moderate increases in heart rate to more severe cardiac arrhythmia. Although tolerance develops to many of the pharmacological effects of caffeine, tolerance may be overwhelmed by the nonlinear accumulation of caffeine when its metabolism becomes saturated. This might occur with high levels of consumption or as the result of a pharmacokinetic interaction between caffeine and over-the-counter or prescription medications. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-inducible cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 participates in the metabolism of caffeine as well as of a number of clinically important drugs. A number of drugs, including certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (particularly fluvoxamine), antiarrhythmics (mexiletine), antipsychotics (clozapine), psoralens, idrocilamide and phenylpropanolamine, bronchodilators (furafylline and theophylline) and quinolones (enoxacin), have been reported to be potent inhibitors of this isoenzyme. This has important clinical implications, since drugs that are metabolised by, or bind to, the same CYP enzyme have a high potential for pharmacokinetic interactions due to inhibition of drug metabolism. Thus, pharmacokinetic interactions at the CYP1A2 enzyme level may cause toxic effects during concomitant administration of caffeine and certain drugs used for cardiovascular, CNS (an excessive dietary intake of caffeine has also been observed in psychiatric patients), gastrointestinal, infectious, respiratory and skin disorders. Unless a lack of interaction has already been demonstrated for the potentially interacting drug, dietary caffeine intake should be considered when planning, or assessing response to, drug therapy. Some of the reported interactions of caffeine, irrespective of clinical relevance, might inadvertently cause athletes to exceed the urinary caffeine concentration limit set by sports authorities at 12 mg/L. Finally, caffeine is a useful and reliable probe drug for the assessment of CYP1A2 activity, which is of considerable interest for metabolic studies in human populations.},

  abstract =    {Twenty-five healthy volunteers were given 100 mg caffeine orally and several estimates of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) activity were evaluated. The validation was performed by correlation of different parameters in plasma, saliva, and urine to two measures of caffeine clearance, CL(oral) and CL(137X-->17X) that served as standards of reference. Two subjects were excluded because of noncompliance with a caffeine-free diet. In the remaining 23 subjects, both plasma and saliva total clearances of caffeine were highly correlated with each other (r(s) = 0.97, p < 0.0001). The ratio 17X/137X restricted to one sampling point taken 4 hours after dose, showed a high correlation (r(s)) with CL(oral) and CL(137X-->17X) in plasma (0.84/0.83) and saliva (0.82/0.77) (p < 0.0001 for all the correlation values) where 17X is 1,7-dimethylxanthine (paraxanthine) and 137X is 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine (caffeine). Additionally, the ratio (AFMU + 1U + 1X + 17U + 17X)/137X in a 0-24 hours urine sampling showed the highest correlation with CL(137X-->17X) (r(s) = 0.85, p < 0.001) where AFMU is 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil, 1U is 1-methyluracil, 1X is 1-methylxanthine, and 17U is 1,7-dimethyluric acid. The major estimates of CYP1A2 activity were significantly less in nonsmoking females, and this probably was related to the use of oral contraceptives in this subpopulation. In summary, among caffeine-based approaches for CYP1A2, the authors recommend either plasma or saliva 17X/137X ratio and the urinary (AFMU + 1U + 1X + 17U + 17X)/137X ratio during a sampling interval of at least 8 hours, starting at time zero since caffeine intake. These indices are simple, reliable, and relatively inexpensive estimates of CYP1A2 activity to be used in the study of human populations.},

Chromatographic separation was performed on an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column using 1 μg/mL acetaminophen as an internal standard. Each sample was run at 0.5 mL/min for a total run time of 7 min/sample. Detection and quantification were performed using a mass spectrometer in selected reaction-monitoring mode with positive electrospray ionization. The lower limit of quantification was 5 ng/mL for all analytes with linear ranges up to 5000 ng/mL for caffeine and 1000 ng/mL for its metabolites. The coefficient of variation for assay precision was less than 12.6\%, with an accuracy of 93.5-114\%. The assay was successfully applied to determine plasma concentrations of caffeine, theobromine, paraxanthine, and theophylline in rat administered various energy drinks containing the same caffeine content. Various energy drinks exhibited considerable variability in the pharmacokinetic profiles of caffeine and its three primary metabolites, even containing the same caffeine. Different additives of energy drinks might contribute to these results.},

  abstract    = {Fluvoxamine is metabolized by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and the smoking-inducible CYP1A2. Therapeutic doses of fluvoxamine inhibit both CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. In this study we used extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) of debrisoquin (INN, debrisoquine) (CYP2D6) and two probes, caffeine (CYP1A2) and omeprazole (CYP2C19), to investigate whether nontherapeutic doses of fluvoxamine inhibit CYP1A2 but possibly not CYP2C19.Single oral doses of 100 mg caffeine and 20 mg omeprazole were given separately to 5 EMs and 5 PMs of debrisoquin to assess the activity of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, respectively. Initially, a single oral dose of fluvoxamine (25 mg to PMs and 50 mg to EMs) was given, followed by 1 week of daily administration of 25 mg x 2 to EMs and 25 mg x 1 to PMs. Caffeine (day 6) and omeprazole (day 7) were again administered at the steady state of fluvoxamine. Later the study protocol was repeated with a lower dose of fluvoxamine, 10 mg x 2 to EMs and 10 mg x 1 to PMs for 1 week. Concentrations of fluvoxamine, caffeine, omeprazole, and their metabolites were analyzed by HPLC methods in plasma and urine.The kinetics of fluvoxamine were not significantly different in EMs and PMs after a single oral dose of the drug. At the higher but not the lower steady-state dose of fluvoxamine, a significantly lower clearance in PMs compared with EMs was observed (geometric mean, 0.86 versus 1.4 L/h per kilogram; P <.05). At steady state, the 25 mg x 1 or x 2 fluvoxamine dose caused a pronounced inhibition of about 75\% to 80\% for both CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, whereas the inhibition after the lower 10 mg x 1 or x 2 dose was about 40\% to 50\%. The area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve from 0 to 24 hours [AUC(0-24)] of caffeine increased 5-fold (P <.001) after the higher dose of fluvoxamine and 2-fold (P <.05) after the lower dose. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 8 hours [AUC(0-8)] ratio of 5-hydroxyomeprazole/omeprazole decreased 3.4-fold (P <.001) and 2.4-fold (P <.001), respectively. One EM subject had a very low oral clearance of fluvoxamine after both single and multiple dosing of the drug. This subject might have a deficient transporter protein in the gut, leading to an increased absorption of fluvoxamine.No convincing evidence was found that CYP2D6 is an important enzyme for the disposition of fluvoxamine. Other factors seem to be more important. A nontherapeutic oral daily dose of fluvoxamine is sufficient to provide a marked inhibition of both caffeine (CYP1A2) and omeprazole (CYP2C19) metabolism. It was not possible to separate the inhibitory effects of fluvoxamine on these enzymes, even after such a low daily dose such as 10 mg x 1 or x 2 of fluvoxamine.},

  abstract =    {The combination of ephedrine and caffeine has been used in herbal products for weight loss and athletic performance-enhancement, but the pharmacokinetic profiles of these compounds have not been well characterized. This study aimed to develop a mechanistic model describing ephedrine, norephedrine, and caffeine pharmacokinetics and their interactions in healthy subjects.The pharmacokinetic model was developed based on the simultaneous modelling using plasma samples gathered from two clinical trials. The treatments consisted of single-doses of pharmaceutical caffeine and ephedrine, given alone or together, and an herbal formulation containing both caffeine and ephedrine. We used a mixed-effect statistical model and the program NONMEM to take account of intersubject variability.Three hundred and seventy-nine ephedrine, 352 norephedrine, 417 caffeine plasma concentrations and 40 ephedrine urine concentrations were obtained from 24 subjects. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption described the caffeine data. Caffeine clearance was 0.083 l min(-1) (CV 38\%) and decreased to 0.038 l min(-1) in presence of oral contraceptive therapy, its volume of distribution was 38.6 l (CV 20\%) and its absorption rate constant was 0.064 l min(-1) (CV 50\%). A four-compartment model described the pharmocokinetics of ephedrine and norephedrine. Ephedrine was eliminated mostly renally, with a clearance of 0.34 l min(-1) (CV 11\%), and a volume of distribution of 181 l (CV 19\%). Nonlinearity in the conversion of ephedrine to norephedrine was observed. Different models showed that the simultaneous administration of caffeine, or the amount of caffeine in the absorption compartment, was associated with a slower rate of absorption of ephedrine. A 32\% greater relative bioavailability of herbal compared with pharmaceutical ephedrine administration was observed.We describe a mechanistic model for ephedrine, norephedrine and caffeine pharmacokinetics and their interactions. The relative bioavailability of ephedrine differed between the herbal supplement compared with the pharmaceutical formulation. Concomitant ingestion of caffeine slowed the absorption rate of ephedrine, which is mainly related to the amount of the former in the absorption compartment. A saturable process appears to be involved in the metabolism of ephedrine to norephedrine.},

  abstract =    {The objective of this paper was to validate a previously developed semi physiological model to simulate bioequivalence trials of drug products. The aim of the model was to ascertain whether the measurement of the metabolite concentration-time profiles would provide any additional information in bioequivalence studies (Fernandez-Teruel et al., 2009a,b; Navarro-Fontestad et al., 2010). The semi-physiological model implemented in NONMEM VI was used to simulate caffeine and its main metabolite plasma levels using caffeine parameters from bibliography. Data from 3 bioequivalence studies in healthy subjects at 3 different doses (100, 175 and 400mg of caffeine) and one study in cirrhotic patients (200 or 250mg) were used. The first aim was to adapt the previous semi-physiological model for caffeine, showing the hepatic metabolism with one main metabolite, paraxanthine. The second aim was to validate the model by comparison of the simulated plasma levels of parent drug and metabolite to the experimental data. The simulations have shown that the proposed semi-physiological model was able to reproduce adequately the pharmacokinetic behavior of caffeine and paraxanthine in both healthy subjects and cirrhotic patients at all the assayed doses. Therefore, the model could be used to simulate plasma concentrations vs. time of drugs with the same pharmacokinetic scheme as caffeine, as long as their population parameters are known, and it could be useful for bioequivalence trial simulation of drugs that undergo hepatic metabolism with a single main metabolite.},

The clinical importance of this interaction is not established.To evaluate the effects of fluvoxamine on the kinetics and dynamics of single doses of caffeine.Seven healthy subjects received single 250 mg doses of caffeine (or matching placebo) together with fluvoxamine (four doses of 100 mg over 2 days) or with matching placebo in a double-blind, four-way crossover study. For 24 h after caffeine or placebo administration, plasma caffeine and fluvoxamine concentrations were determined. Psychomotor performance, sedation, and electroencephalographic (EEG) "beta" frequency activity were also assessed.Fluvoxamine significantly reduced apparent oral clearance of caffeine (105 vs. 9.1 mL min(-1), P < 0.01; mean difference: 95.7 mL min(-1), 95\% CI: 54.9-135.6), and prolonged its elimination half-life (4.9 vs. 56 h, P < 0.01; mean difference: 51 h, 95\% CI: 26-76). Caffeine produced CNS-stimulating effects compared with placebo. However, psychomotor performance, alertness, or EEG effects attributable to caffeine were not augmented by coadministration of fluvoxamine.Fluvoxamine greatly impaired caffeine clearance, but without detectable changes in caffeine pharmacodynamics. However, this study does not rule out possible adverse effects due to extensive accumulation of caffeine with daily ingestion in fluvoxamine-treated individuals.},

  abstract    = {Some recent epidemiologic studies have reported a nonlinear dose-response in the relationship between coffee consumption and health risks, such that the risks increase disproportionately to the increase in dose. Assuming caffeine contributes to the adverse health effects of coffee, a possible explanation for the nonlinear dose-response relationship is dose-dependent metabolism of caffeine. We examined the hypothesis that under chronic dosing conditions the metabolism of caffeine is dose-dependent. Nine healthy subjects were given, in randomized 5-day treatment blocks, placebo, 4.2 (low) and 12 (high) mg/kg/day caffeine in decaffeinated coffee, in six divided doses spaced throughout the day. On the third day of each dosing period, 25 mg of stable-isotope labeled caffeine (2-13C, 1,3-15N2) was given intravenously. Clearance of labeled caffeine fell from 0.118 (placebo treatment) to 0.069 (low dose; p less than 0.005) and to 0.54 (high dose; p less than 0.001) L/hr/kg. The formation and metabolite clearances of paraxanthine, the major primary metabolite of caffeine, also decreased comparing the low and high doses (p less than 0.05). We conclude that caffeine metabolism is dose-dependent, resulting in nonlinear accumulation of methylxanthines in the body. Dose-dependent metabolism of caffeine may explain in part why people who drink large amounts of coffee are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease.},

  abstract =    {We have recently demonstrated dose-dependency of caffeine metabolism under multiple dosing conditions. Whether there are persistent pharmacodynamic actions of caffeine under such circumstances is the focus of this report. Nine healthy subjects were given, in randomized 5 day blocks, placebo, 4.2 (low) and 12 (high) mg.kg-1.day-1 of caffeine in 6 divided doses. After 5 days, complete tolerance developed to the effects of caffeine on blood pressure, heart rate and plasma glucose concentrations. The 24-h area under the curve (AUC) for plasma norepinephrine and the AUC for the total sum of free fatty acids (FFA) both demonstrated a trend to increase with the high dose caffeine treatment. When the AUC for norepinephrine was split into 12 h time periods, a significant difference between the placebo and the high dose treatment block was seen. We conclude that regular consumption of 12 mg.kg-1 of caffeine per day (equivalent to approximately 6 to 11 cups of coffee per day) may produce pharmacodynamic effects not completely compensated for by the development of tolerance. Mechanisms of tolerance may be overwhelmed by the nonlinear accumulation of caffeine and other methylxanthines in the body when caffeine metabolism becomes saturable.},

  abstract    = {A number of caffeine metabolite ratios have been proposed to measure CYP1A2 activity in vivo. The data to validate these ratios are scanty. The objective of this study was to validate urine caffeine metabolite ratios versus stable isotope-labeled caffeine clearance under different caffeine dosing conditions.Two experiments, one with nine nonsmoking subjects and the other with 12 cigarette smokers, were performed. We explored the relationship between caffeine clearance, measured by means of intravenous infusions of stable isotope-labeled caffeine, and a number of caffeine metabolite ratios during administration of different single or multiple doses of caffeine to smokers and nonsmokers on three different occasions over a 2-week period, using different durations of urine collections, including spot urines. The stable isotope technique allowed simultaneous oral dosing of caffeine and measurement of caffeine metabolite ratios and caffeine clearance, the latter reflecting CYP1A2 activity.The caffeine metabolite ratio of AAMU + 1U +1X/17U (5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil + 1-methyluric acid + 1 methylxanthine/1,7-dimethyluric acid) maintained a significant correlation with caffeine clearance for all the above conditions (gamma2 range, 0.4 to 0.9) except for dose. With high doses of caffeine (12 mg/kg), a significant relationship was not observed. AAMU + 1U + 1X/17U also correlated with the formation clearance of paraxanthine (gamma2 = 0.6, p = 0.002). Other reported caffeine metabolite ratios did not display the same robust correlation with caffeine clearance under all these different conditions.We conclude that AAMU+1U+1X/17U measured from a single spot urine collection is a valid measure of CYP1A2 activity except at very high levels of caffeine dosing. The validity of the other proposed caffeine metabolite ratios is questionable.},

  abstract    = {Simplified pharmacokinetic methods have been used to estimate caffeine clearance in subjects with liver disease. There is a need to have a reliable, easy to implement method for research and possible clinical use. This study evaluates the use of Bayesian pharmacokinetic forecasting techniques to estimate caffeine clearance and compares its performance to other published methods. Commonly used published methods include the two-concentration overnight salivary clearance method (Jost method) and a method that samples caffeine concentrations over a 4-hour time period (Nagel method). Both have been used in studies incorporating serial measurements of caffeine clearance to predict clinical outcomes in subjects with liver disease, but these approaches have not been proven useful. However, neither method has been formally evaluated for accuracy in estimating caffeine clearance in subjects with cirrhosis. The performance of the Jost, Nagel, and Bayesian methods was compared to a Gold Standard method that accurately measured caffeine clearance in healthy subjects and subjects with cirrhosis using an intravenous infusion of stable isotope-labeled caffeine. The Bayesian method, even when only one measured concentration of caffeine was used, was more accurate, better correlated to the Gold Standard method, and had less intraindividual variation than the two previously published methods. Before the idea of using serial measurements of caffeine clearance for clinical usefulness is rejected, a reevaluation using methods of estimating caffeine clearance that are more accurate than previous paradigms is needed.},

Silexan (160 mg) or placebo were administered once daily for 11 days. Additionally, on day 11 of both study periods, 150 mg caffeine (CYP1A2), 125 mg tolbutamide (CYP2C9), 20 mg omeprazole (CYP2C19), 30 mg dextromethorphan-HBr (CYP2D6), and 2 mg midazolam (CYP3A4) were administered orally. Formal interaction was excluded if the 90\% confidence interval (CI) for the silexan over placebo ratios for phenotyping metrics (primary: AUC(0-t)) was within a 0.70-1.43 range.According to the AUC(0-t) comparisons, silexan had no relevant effect on CYP1A2, 2C9, 2D6, and 3A4 activity. Secondary phenotyping metrics confirmed this result. Mean ratios for all omeprazole-derived metrics were close to unity. The 90\% CI for the AUC(0-t) ratio of omeprazole but not for omeprazole/5-OH-omeprazole plasma ratio 3 hours post-dose or omeprazole/5-OH-omeprazole AUC(0-t) ratio (secondary CYP2C19 metrics) was above the predefined threshold of 1.43, probably caused by the inherent high variability of omeprazole pharmacokinetics. Silexan and the phenotyping drugs were well tolerated. Repeated silexan (160 mg/day) administration has no clinically relevant inhibitory or inducing effects on the CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 enzymes in vivo.},

  abstract    = {Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 activity is induced by cigarette smoking. Thus smoking cessation in patients while they are undergoing therapy with a CYP1A2 substrate such as theophylline or clozapine increases its concentrations and may cause adverse effects. Our objective was to determine the time course of CYP1A2 activity changes after smoking cessation in heavy smokers as the basis for dosing adaptation schemes.The study was conducted in 8 men and 4 women (all white) who smoked 20 cigarettes or more per day. Sudden smoking cessation was carried out after a 14-day run-in period. Subjects were phenotyped for CYP1A2 activity at 6, 4, and 1 day before smoking cessation and at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 13 days thereafter by use of the paraxanthine-to-caffeine ratio in plasma 6 hours after a 148-mg caffeine test dose. A monoexponential decay of CYP1A2 activity to a residual value was fitted to the data by nonlinear regression analysis.On cessation of smoking, initial caffeine clearance (estimated geometric means and 95\% confidence intervals) decreased significantly (P <.01), by 36.1\% (30.9\%-42.2\%), from 2.47 mL. min(-1). kg(-1) body weight (2.03-3.00 mL. min(-1). kg(-1) body weight) to a new steady state of 1.53 mL. min(-1). kg(-1) body weight (1.24-1.89 mL. min(-1). kg(-1) body weight). The apparent half-life of CYP1A2 activity decrease was 38.6 hours (27.4-54.4 hours).Doses of CYP1A2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic range should be decreased immediately on cessation of heavy smoking. As a rule of thumb, a stepwise daily dose reduction of approximately 10\% until the fourth day after smoking cessation is proposed, which should be accompanied by therapeutic drug monitoring.},

  abstract =    {Several procedures to monitor CYP1A2 activity in vivo by the use of caffeine as a probe have been proposed. They comprise caffeine clearance, based on both plasma and saliva concentrations, urinary metabolite ratios, the 13C-caffeine breath test, and the paraxanthine/caffeine ratio in plasma. The latter method is fast, simple, economical and restricted to one sampling point. In this study, we retrospectively analysed four clinical trials comprising 78 subjects to validate the use of the paraxanthine/caffeine ratios in plasma and saliva for CYP1A2 activity. The validation was done by correlation of these ratios to the systemic caffeine clearance as a reference method. Additionally, urinary metabolite ratios and the caffeine breath test were included in the analysis. The paraxanthine/caffeine ratios in plasma and saliva preferably 5-7 h after administration of caffeine most closely resembled systemic caffeine clearance with correlation coefficients typically higher than r = 0.85. An equation to estimate systemic caffeine clearance from the paraxanthine/caffeine ratios taken at any time within 3-7 h postdose was developed. Correlations of systemic clearance with urinary metabolite ratios and the caffeine breath test were less reliable both in this investigation and in the literature. In conclusion, the paraxanthine/caffeine ratios in plasma and saliva appear a valid and inexpensive method of assessing CYP1A2 activity in vivo. Apparent distribution of CYP1A2 activity for all healthy subjects appeared bimodal in nonsmokers (n = 29) and smokers (n = 17).},

However, how much of the variation in phenotyping parameters may be attributed to variations in CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 activities has not been determined. Therefore, this study intraindividually compared enzyme activities and/or content in liver samples with pharmacokinetic parameters of caffeine in vivo after administration of a test dose in 25 patients undergoing hepatectomy. Parameters measured in vitro were the high affinity components of caffeine 3-demethylation and phenacetin 0-deethylation, microsomal CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 immunoreactivity, and cytosolic sulfamethazine N-acetylation. Caffeine parameters in vivo included caffeine clearance from plasma and/or saliva, paraxanthine/caffeine ratios in plasma and saliva, plasma theophylline/caffeine ratio, and several metabolite ratios from spot urine sampled 6 h postdose. Correlations between parameters were determined using weighted linear regression analyses. Caffeine clearance and paraxanthine/caffeine ratios correlated most highly to intrinsic clearance of caffeine 3-demethylation and to CYP1A2 immunoreactivity (r= 0.584-0.82), whereas urinary CYP1A2 ratios correlated less strongly with CYP1A2 parameters in vitro. Assignment of acetylator phenotype by urinary NAT2 ratios was concordant with sulfamethazine-N-acetylation in vitro. In contrast to CYP1A2 parameters in vitro, CYP2E1 immunoreactivity was not related to the theophylline/caffeine plasma ratio. CYP1A2 activity, thus, is the major determinant of caffeine clearance and the paraxanthine/caffeine ratios in vivo, of which the saliva ratio 6 h postdose appears as the most advantageous parameter. The results confirm that phenotyping using caffeine provides valid estimates of CYP1A2 and NAT2 activity.},

Smokers had a significantly higher 17X/137X ratio (higher CYP1A2 activity) than non-smokers, while Swedish OC users had a significantly lower 17X/137X ratio than non-users (mean difference: 0.31, 95\% CI of the mean difference: 0.23, 0.39; p < 0.0001). No effect of gender differences on enzyme activity was observed. Four known (CYP1A2*1A, *1D, *1F, and *1L) and two novel haplotypes (CYP1A2*1V and CYP1A2*1W) were found. CYP1A2*1K was rare in Swedes and absent in Koreans. No significant genotype-phenotype relationship was observed, with the exception of CYP1A2*1F in Swedish smokers, where it was associated with higher enzyme inducibility (p = 0.02). Koreans displayed a significantly lower mean 17X/137X ratio than Swedes having the same CYP1A2 genotype, smoking habit and OC use.We found significant differences in CYP1A2 enzyme activity between Swedes and Koreans that could not be explained by environmental factors or the CYP1A2 haplotypes examined, despite differences in allele frequencies. None of the investigated CYP1A2 haplotypes are critical in inducing variations in enzyme activity, with the exception of CYP1A2*1F.},

  abstract    = {Children's risks can differ from those in adults for numerous reasons, one being differences in the pharmacokinetic handling of chemicals. Immature metabolism and a variety of other factors in neonates can affect chemical disposition and clearance. These factors can be incorporated into physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models that simulate the fate of environmental toxicants in both children and adults. PBPK models are most informative when supported by empirical data, but typically pediatric pharmacokinetic data for toxicants are not available. In contrast, pharmacokinetic data in children are readily available for therapeutic drugs. The current analysis utilizes data for caffeine and theophylline, closely related xanthines that are both cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 1A2 substrates, in developing PBPK models for neonates and adults. Model development involved scale-up of in vitro metabolic parameters to whole liver and adjusting metabolic function for the ontological pattern of CYP1A2 and other CYPs. Model runs were able to simulate the large differences in half-life and clearance between neonates and adults. Further, the models were able to reproduce the faster metabolic clearance of theophylline relative to caffeine in neonates. This differential between xanthines was found to be due primarily to an extra metabolic pathway available to theophylline, back-methylation to caffeine, that is not available to caffeine itself. This pathway is not observed in adults exemplifying the importance of secondary or novel routes of metabolism in the immature liver. Greater CYP2E1 metabolism of theophylline relative to caffeine in neonates also occurs. Neonatal PBPK models developed for these drugs may be adapted to other CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., arylamine toxicants). A stepwise approach for modeling environmental toxicants in children is proposed.},

  abstract =    {The nature of the cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme reactions giving rise to four primary metabolites of caffeine was investigated using microsomes isolated from livers of human kidney donors. Metabolite formation proceeded at a lower rate than that predicted from in vivo caffeine elimination half-lives, as has been observed in other species using this compound as a substrate in microsomal incubations. Kinetic experiments indicated that the formation of each of the N-demethylated metabolites paraxanthine, theobromine and theophyline was mediated by both a high- and a low-affinity catalytic site over a substrate concentration range from 0.05 mM to 80.0 mM, although only the high-affinity component is likely to be of any importance at normally encountered in vivo caffeine concentrations. 7-Ethoxyresorufin and acetanilide, selective substrates for two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-inducible isozymes of cytochrome P-450 in the mouse (P1-450 and P3-450, respectively) were each able to inhibit competitively the formation of caffeine metabolites by human liver microsomes, while caffeine could in turn similarly inhibit the biotransformations of these two compounds. The isozyme-selective P-450 inhibitor alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF) potently inhibited the high-affinity component of caffeine N-demethylations, while 1-phenylimidazole (PI) was a more potent inhibitor of the low-affinity component. The inhibition studies also indicated that the formation of 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid was mediated by both ANF-sensitive and PI-sensitive sites. Taken together, the data support suggestions from in vivo studies that a PAH-inducible isozyme of cytochrome P-450 plays a significant role in the biotransformation of caffeine in man.},

  abstract    = {Phenotyping by probe substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and other metabolizing enzymes is widely used to assess the effects of genes, environment and ethnicity on the in vivo metabolism of drugs and environmental chemicals. The caffeine metabolic ratio, in urine, plasma or saliva, has been used extensively as an index of CYP1A2, N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), xanthine oxidase (XO) and CYP2A6 enzymatic activities. Phenotyping using plasma or saliva samples to measure the paraxanthine to caffeine (17X/137X) ratio correlates well with many measures of CYP1A2 activity. Various urinary metabolic ratios for caffeine phenotyping have been proposed, but shortcomings have been demonstrated for all the proposed urinary metabolic ratios. Several groups have proposed the urinary ratio of (1-methylxanthine (1X) + 1-methylurate (1U) + 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil (AFMU)) to 1, 7-dimethylurate (17U) i.e. (1X + 1U + AFMU)/17U as the preferred metabolic ratio for CYP1A2 activity (independent of urine flow rate). There is no consensus on the best urinary metabolic ratio for NAT2, XO or CYP2A6 enzymatic activities. Caffeine has been used by different groups to evaluate the in vivo activity of CYP1A2, NAT2, XO and CYP2A6 in different populations and the effect of many factors on these activities. Caffeine has been also used as a constituent of a "cocktail" to phenotype several enzymes simultaneously. In conclusion, phenotyping using caffeine as a probe substrate may still provide useful assessment of CYP1A2, NAT2, XO and CYP2A6 activities in epidemiologic and drug-drug interaction studies despite the limitations that are associated with its use.},

  abstract =    {Serious cardiovascular toxicity has been reported in people taking dietary supplements that contain ma huang (Ephedra) and guarana (caffeine). We assessed the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a dietary supplement that contains these herbal stimulants.Eight healthy adults received a single oral dose of a thermogenic dietary supplement labeled to contain 20 mg ephedrine alkaloids and 200 mg caffeine after an overnight fast. Serial plasma and urine samples were analyzed by use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for ephedrine alkaloid and caffeine concentrations, and heart rate and blood pressure were monitored for 14 hours.Plasma clearance and elimination half-lives for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and caffeine were comparable to published values reported for drug formulations. A prolonged half-life of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine was observed in 1 subject with the highest urine pH. Mean systolic blood pressure increased significantly to a maximum of 14 mm Hg above baseline at 90 minutes after ingestion (P <.001). There was a lag in the mean heart rate response that reached a maximum change of 15 beats/min above baseline at 6 hours after ingestion (P <.001). Diastolic blood pressure changes were insignificant. Two subjects who were taking oral contraceptives had longer caffeine half-lives (15.5 +/- 0.3 hours versus 5.6 +/- 1.7 hours) and lower values for oral clearance (0.34 +/- 0.01 mL/min. kg versus 0.99 +/- 0.41 mL/min. kg) than subjects who were not taking oral contraceptives.Botanical stimulants have disposition characteristics similar to their pharmaceutical counterparts, and they can produce significant cardiovascular responses after a single dose.},

  abstract    = {The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine is a very potent inhibitor of the liver enzyme CYP1A2, which is the major P450 catalysing the biotransformation of caffeine. Thus, a pharmacokinetic study was undertaken with the purpose of documenting a drug-drug interaction between fluvoxamine and caffeine. The study was carried out as a randomized, in vivo, cross-over study including eight healthy volunteers. In Period A of the study, each subject took 200 mg caffeine orally, and in Period B, the subjects took fluvoxamine 50 mg per day for 4 days and 100 mg per day for 8 days. On day 8 in Period B, the subjects again ingested 200 mg caffeine. After caffeine intake, blood and urine were sampled at regular intervals. Caffeine and its three primary demethylated metabolites, paraxanthine, theobromine and theophylline in plasma and the same four compounds plus 11 more metabolites in urine were assayed by HPLC. During fluvoxamine, the median of the total clearance of caffeine decreased from 107 ml min-1 to 21 ml min-1 and the half-life increased from 5 to 31 h. The N3-demethylation clearance of caffeine to paraxanthine decreased from 46 to 9 ml min-1; the N1- and N7-demethylation clearances decreased from 21 to 9 ml min-1 and from 14 to 6 ml min-1, respectively. The results confirm that CYP1A2 is the main enzyme catalysing the biotransformation of caffeine, in particular the N3-demethylation and partly the N1- and N7-demethylation. The results indicate that intake of caffeine during fluvoxamine treatment may lead to caffeine intoxication. Finally, our study provides additional evidence that fluvoxamine can be used to probe CYP1A2 in drug metabolism.},

All volunteers had been identified as sparteine- and mephenytoin-extensive metabolisers. The volunteers received in randomised order, at weekly intervals, increasing single oral doses of one of the four SSRIs, followed 3 h later by sparteine (CYP2D6), mephenytoin (CYP2C19) and caffeine (CYP1A2) tests. Fluoxetine was given at 3-week intervals because of the long half-life of fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine. Citalopram, fluoxetine and paroxetine were given in doses of 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg and fluvoxamine was given in doses of 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg.With increasing doses, there was a statistically significant increase in the sparteine metabolic ratio (MR) (P < 0.01, Page's test for trend) for all four SSRIs. The increase was modest after intake of citalopram and fluvoxamine, while the increase was more pronounced after fluoxetine intake, although no volunteers changed phenotype from extensive metabolisers to poor metabolisers. Three of the six volunteers changed phenotype from extensive metabolisers to poor metabolisers after intake of 40 or 80 mg paroxetine. There was a statistically significant increase in the mephenytoin S/R ratio (P < 0.01, Page's test for trend) with increasing doses of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, but not after citalopram and paroxetine. However, no volunteers changed phenotype from extensive to poor metabolisers of S-mephenytoin. After intake of fluvoxamine, the urinary excretion of the metabolites related to N3 demethylation of caffeine were below the limit of quantification, whereas there were no significant changes in the urinary caffeine metabolic ratios after intake of the other three SSRIs.This investigation confirms that paroxetine and fluoxetine are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, that fluvoxamine and fluoxetine are moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19 and that fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 in humans in vivo. The clinical prediction of interaction from single-dose experiments may have to take the degree of accumulation during steady-state after multiple doses into account.},

The cocktail was administered alone, then, after a 14-day washout, etravirine 200 mg twice daily (bid) was given for 14 days with cocktail on days 1 and 14. In a separate study, digoxin (0.5 mg) was administered alone, then, after a 14-day washout, etravirine 200 mg bid was administered for 12 days with digoxin on day 8. In the cocktail study, the AUClast least squares mean (LSM) ratios (90\% confidence intervals [CIs]) for cocktail + etravirine versus cocktail were 0.93 (0.88, 0.99; paraxanthine), 0.58 (0.44, 0.75; 7-OH-S-warfarin), 0.43 (0.20, 0.96; 5-OH-omeprazole), 0.85 (0.78, 0.94; dextrorphan), and 0.69 (0.64, 0.74; midazolam). Digoxin AUC0-8h was slightly increased with etravirine coadministration (LSM ratio 1.18 [0.90, 1.56]). These data suggest that etravirine is a weak CYP3A isozyme inducer and minimally inhibits CYP2C9, 2C19, and P-glycoprotein activity.},

In a population study, both indexes showed a log normal distribution, with CYP1A2 values of most subjects covering a 6.3-fold range but only a 1.7-fold range with xanthine oxidase. The CYP1A2 index was 33\% decreased in women who used oral contraceptives and substantially increased in cigarette smokers.

  abstract =    {Whether the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy increases the risk of spontaneous abortion is controversial. Prior studies have determined caffeine consumption by questionnaire. We used a biologic marker, such as serum paraxanthine, a metabolite of caffeine, to measure the dose of caffeine.In a nested case-control study, we measured serum paraxanthine in 591 women who had spontaneous abortions at less than 140 days' gestation and in 2558 matched women from the same clinic who gave birth to live infants at 28 weeks' gestation or later and who had serum drawn on the same day of gestation as the women who had abortions. The women were enrolled in the Collaborative Perinatal Project during the period from 1959 to 1966, and serum paraxanthine was measured over 30 years later.A total of 487 women who had spontaneous abortions (82 percent) and 2087 controls (82 percent) had quantifiable serum paraxanthine concentrations. However, the mean serum paraxanthine concentration was higher in the women who had spontaneous abortions than in the controls (752 vs. 583 ng per milliliter, P<0.001). The odds ratio for spontaneous abortion was not significantly elevated in the women who had serum paraxanthine concentrations of 1845 ng per milliliter or lower, corresponding to the 95th percentile of the matched women. However, the adjusted odds ratio for spontaneous abortion among women with serum paraxanthine concentrations higher than 1845 ng per milliliter, as compared with women who had concentrations below 50 ng per milliliter, was 1.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.8).Only extremely high serum paraxanthine concentrations are associated with spontaneous abortion. This suggests that moderate consumption of caffeine is unlikely to increase the risk of spontaneous abortion.},

With this HPLC method caffeine and paraxanthine can be determined selectively and specifically.

The limits of detection for caffeine and paraxanthine using this HPLC system were 0.3 and 0.1 mg/L, respectively. Linear calibration curves for both caffeine and paraxanthine were obtained in the concentration range 0.5-30 mg/L (r > 0.9999.

The aim of the study was to determine the utility of CBT in the assessment of cirrhosis and its correlation to the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score.Thirty-nine patients, 29 with cirrhosis and 10 with chronic liver disease without cirrhosis, and 8 healthy volunteers were included. Cirrhotic patients were graded according to Child-Pugh and MELD scores. All participants underwent CBT and laboratory tests on the same day. The results of the CBT were expressed as percentages of changes over baseline values (Δ‰) per 100 mg caffeine.The mean single 15-min, 30-min, 45-min and 1-h CBT results, as well as cumulative CBT values differed significantly between healthy controls or chronic liver disease patients and cirrhotics (1-h CBT: 3.22±1.06 or 3.56±2.80 vs. 1.69±2.52, P≤0.01). In contrast, the CBT results at any time point or cumulative values did not correlate with MELD or Child-Pugh scores. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis showed that the 30-min CBT values were more accurate in differentiating cirrhotics from chronic liver disease patients (area under ROC curve: 0.871).CBT can reliably differentiate the patients with decompensated cirrhosis from non-cirrhotic patients with chronic liver diseases. However, in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, CBT results do not seem to be associated with the Child-Pugh and MELD scores.},

  abstract =    {The current knowledge on the involvement of cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) isoforms in the metabolism of caffeine in rat and human liver is reviewed. Attention is also paid to species- and concentration-dependent metabolism of caffeine. Finally, we discuss the P450-mediated metabolism of caffeine in relation to coffee addiction and drug interactions. Due to its safety, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and P450 isoform-selective metabolism, caffeine has great potential as a metabolic marker substance in both humans and rats, and as a more universal metabolic tool in the latter species. However, the qualitative and relative quantitative contribution of P450 isoforms to the metabolism of caffeine is species- and concentration-dependent. While 3-N-demethylation is quantitatively the main oxidation pathway in human, 8-hydroxylation is the dominant metabolic pathway in rat. Both of these main reactions in the two species are specifically catalyzed by CYP1A2. Caffeine may be applied as a marker substance for assessing the activity of CYP1A2 in human and rat liver, but by using different reactions: 3-N-demethylation in humans and C-8-hydroxylation in rats. In addition, caffeine can be used to preliminarily and simultaneously estimate CYP2C activity in rat liver using 7-N-demethylation as a marker reaction. On the other hand, CYP3A4-catalyzed 8-hydroxylation in humans is not sufficiently isoform-specific to mark the activity of CYP3A4. Caffeine pharmacokinetics may be changed by drugs affecting the activity of CYP1A2 (human and rat) or CYP2C (rat), e.g. via autoinduction or by treatment with certain antidepressants or neuroleptics. Therefore, patients taking caffeine-containing medicine or coffee drinkers taking drugs that interact with CYP1A2 may require proper dosage adjustments upon caffeine ingestion and cessation.},

Using areas under the plasma concentration-time curves for each of the dimethylxanthines derived from CA in the steady-state study and individual plasma clearances of PX, TB and TP determined in the previous study, the fractional conversion of CA to PX, TB and TP and the individual partial clearances of CA have been defined. The mean (+/- s.d.) fractional conversion of CA to PX, TB and TP was 79.6 +/- 21.0\%, 10.8 +/- 2.4\% and 3.7 +/- 1.3\%, respectively. When only demethylation pathways are considered PX, TB and TP accounted for 83.9 +/- 5.4\%, 12.1 +/- 4.1\% and 4.0 +/- 1.4\%, respectively of the CA demethylations. The mean partial clearance of CA to PX was approximately 8-fold and 23-fold greater than those to TB and TP respectively. These data confirm earlier reports that PX is the major metabolite of CA in humans but suggest that PX formation is quantitatively more important than previously believed.},

  abstract =    {1. Caffeine (CA) is metabolized extensively and at least 17 metabolites arising from primary and secondary biotransformation pathways are found in urine following CA ingestion. The enzymes responsible for the formation of most of the metabolites derived from CA have been identified. 2. Given the near ubiquitous consumption of CA, this compound potentially constitutes a useful substrate probe for assessment of certain xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme activities in vivo. Indeed, various ratios of CA metabolites excreted in urine (urinary metabolic ratios; MRs) are now utilized widely for the population screening of enzyme activities. 3. Excretion of the acetylated secondary metabolite 5-actylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil (AFMU) is dependent on the activity of the polymorphic N-acetyltransferase (NAT2), and certain MRs incorporating AFMU may be used for NAT2 phenotyping. 4. The conversion of 1-methylxanthine (1-MX), another secondary metabolite of CA, to 1-methyluric acid (1-MU) is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase (XO), and the urinary 1-MU to 1MX ratio reflects XO activity. 5. N3-demethylation to form paraxanthine (PX), a reaction mediated by cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2), is the dominant primary metabolic pathway of CA. CA N3-demethylation activity may be used as a measure of human hepatic CYP1A2 in vitro. 6. Plasma CA clearance is considered to reflect CYP1A2 activity in vivo. Although a number of MRs are based on the excretion of PX metabolites (PX derived from CA is employed for the assessment of CYP1A2 activity in vivo), factors other than enzyme activity may affect these ratios.},

Caffeine was also given to a single subject intravenously in doses of 300, 500 and 750 mg. Caffeine was rapidly absorbed and was completely available at all doses. The apparent first-order elimination rate constant decreased linearly with dose and was 0.163 +/- 0.081 h-1 for 50 mg and 0.098 +/- 0.027 h-1 for 750 mg. The total body clearance was unaffected by dose and was 0.98 +/- 0.38 ml/min/kg. There was a trend towards increasing apparent volume of distribution with increasing dose. A linear relationship existed between the area under the plasma concentration, time curve and dose and dose-normalised plasma concentration, time plots were superimposable. These findings suggest that caffeine obeys linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range investigated. Despite significant inter-individual differences in pharmacokinetic parameters there was good reproducibility within 5 subjects given 300 mg caffeine orally on 3 occasions. Salivary caffeine levels probably reflect the unbound plasma caffeine concentration and can be used to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug. Overall the saliva/plasma concentration ratio was 0.74 +/- 0.08 but within subjects some time-dependence of the ratio was found with higher ratios initially (even after intravenous administration) and lower ratios at longer time intervals after the dose. Urinary elimination of caffeine was low and independent of dose: 1.83\% of the dose was eliminated unchanged.},

CYP isoform specific substrates and their metabolites of CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 (losartan), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan) and CYP3A (midazolam) were all simultaneously analyzed using LC-MS/MS after administration of a mixture of five drugs (i.e., a "cocktail approach") to healthy volunteers. The assay uses propranolol as an internal standard; dual liquid extraction; a Xbridge MS C(18) (100 mm × 2.1mm, 3.5 μm) column; a gradient mobile phase of 0.1\% formic acid/acetonitrile (7/3→3/7); mass spectrometric detection in positive ion mode. The method was validated from 5 to 500 ng/mL for caffeine and paraxanthine, 0.1-40 ng/mL for losartan and EXP3174, 0.05-20 ng/mL for omeprazole and 5-hydroxyomeprazole, 0.008-0.8 ng/mL for dextromethorphan and dextrorphan, 0.01-1.0 ng/mL for midazolam, and 0.04-4 ng/mL for 1'-hydroxymidazolam. The intra- and inter-day precision over the concentration ranges for all analytes were lower than 12.5\% and 13.8\% (relative standard deviation, \%RSD), and accuracy was between 86.5\% and 108.4\% and between 87.0\% and 107.0\%, respectively.

We used the caffeine breath test to assess the metabolising activity of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme in underweight children.Underweight children from the paediatric outpatient clinic, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja in Nigeria, were studied. After an overnight fast, 15 underweight children took 3 mg/kg labelled caffeine orally. Breath samples were collected in duplicate at -20, -10 and -1 min and at 15 min intervals for 2 h. The mean cumulative per cent dose recovered (CPDR) of labelled caffeine in the expired carbon dioxide was determined over the study period. This was repeated after 2-6 weeks of nutritional rehabilitation.The mean areas under the enrichment-time curve before and after nutritional rehabilitation were 0.539±0.320 and 0.620±0.322 atom per cent excess minute, respectively. The difference between the two values was not statistically significant (p=0.528). The mean CPDR in the exhaled carbon dioxide of the underweight children over a period of 2 h was 7.56±4.01\% and 7.95±3.68\% before and after nutritional rehabilitation, respectively, and there was no significant difference in the mean values (p=0.603).The metabolism of caffeine was not significantly affected in underweight children compared with after 2-6 weeks of nutritional rehabilitation. This suggests that hepatic CYP1A2-metabolising activity was not significantly impaired in underweight children.},

  abstract =    {The properties of caffeine render it an ideal substrate for a quantitative test of liver function. The aim of this study was to determine whether the caffeine breath test (CBT) using orally administered 13C-caffeine correlates reliably with plasma caffeine clearance and reflects varying degrees of liver dysfunction. The CBT was performed in 25 healthy controls; 20 subjects with noncirrhotic, chronic hepatitis B or C; and 20 subjects with cirrhosis. Plasma caffeine clearance was assayed simultaneously with the CBT in a cohort of these subjects. Over a broad range of caffeine clearances, the CBT exhibited a highly significant correlation with plasma clearance (r = 0.85, P <.001). Cirrhotic patients were characterized by significantly reduced CBT values (1.15 +/- 0.75 delta per thousand mg(-1)) compared with controls (2.23 +/- 0.76; P =.001) and hepatitic patients (1.83 +/- 1.05; P =.04). There was a significant inverse relationship between the CBT and Child-Pugh score (r = -.74, P =.002). The intraclass correlation coefficient between repeated CBTs in 20 subjects with normal and cirrhotic livers was 0.89. Although smoking was associated with an 86\% to 141\% increase in CBT in all groups, the CBT was able to distinguish control, hepatitic, and cirrhotic smokers (5.36 +/- 0.82, 3.63 +/- 1.21, and 2.14 +/- 1.14, respectively, P =.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that only smoking (P <.001) and disease state (P =.001) were significant predictors of the CBT. In conclusion, the 13C-CBT represents a valid indicator of plasma caffeine clearance and correlates reproducibly with hepatic dysfunction.},

  abstract    = {To investigate the utility of metrics of CYP1A2 activity using caffeine as a probe, and saliva and plasma sampling with or without a 24-h caffeine abstinence.This was a cross-over pharmacokinetic study in 30 healthy male subjects who received a single oral 100mg caffeine dose after 24-h caffeine abstinence or after maintaining their regular caffeine intake (no caffeine abstinence). Serial blood and saliva samples were collected simultaneously over 24h. Caffeine and paraxanthine concentrations were measured using a validated HPLC assay.There was a strong correlation between the paraxanthine/caffeine AUC(0-24) ratio (reference metric) and the paraxanthine/caffeine concentration (C(t) ) ratio at 4h (C(4) ) in both saliva and plasma (r≥0.75). The paraxanthine/caffeine AUC(0-24) ratio in plasma and saliva did not differ between the 24-h caffeine abstinence and the no abstinence period (P>0.05). The optimal paraxanthine/caffeine C(t) that correlated with the plasma paraxanthine/caffeine AUC(0-24) ratio in the 24-h abstinence period was 2 and 4h (r=0.88) in plasma, and 4 and 6h in saliva (r=0.70), while it was the saliva 4h time-point in the no abstinence period (r=0.78).The saliva paraxanthine/caffeine concentration ratio at 4h was a suitable metric to assess CYP1A2 activity after oral administration of caffeine without the need for 24-h caffeine abstinence.},

  abstract =    {The drug metabolising enzyme CYP1A2 contributes to the metabolism of a number of medicines including clozapine, olanzapine and theophylline. These medicines display a high degree of inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics and response. Measuring CYP1A2 activity in vivo can be an important tool to identify the factors that influence variability in drug pharmacokinetics and inform dose selection. Caffeine is the only currently accepted probe to conduct in vivo phenotyping of CYP1A2. Despite the number of proposed matrices (biological fluid containing the drug and/or metabolite/s of interest) and metrics (mathematical formula relating the drug and/or metabolite/s to enzyme activity) proposed to measure CYP1A2 activity using caffeine, many of these are compromised by factors related to the specific metabolic pathway studied or pharmacokinetic characteristics of caffeine and its metabolites. Furthermore, questions regarding the appropriate study design and methodology to conduct studies to evaluate CYP1A2 activity have often been overlooked. These issues include the potential influence of a methylxanthine abstinence period prior to caffeine CYP1A2 phenotyping and the impact of caffeine formulation on determining CYP1A2 activity. This review aims to discuss the various CYP1A2 matrices and metrics with a particular focus on unresolved methodological issues.},

This study developed and evaluated a mixed-effects pharmacokinetic model for caffeine and paraxanthine concentration-time data derived from a sequential single-dose cross-over study in healthy male volunteers (n = 30) who received oral 100 mg caffeine doses. Participants received caffeine with and without a MA period. Participants were classified as low (0-100 mg/d), medium (100-200 mg/d), or high (>200 mg/d) caffeine consumers (LCCs, MCCs, or HCCs, respectively). All caffeine and paraxanthine concentration-time data were simultaneously modeled. Caffeine pharmacokinetics was described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and two first-order elimination pathways. Paraxanthine was described by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. Among LCCs (n = 16) and MCCs (n = 9), there was no difference in the mean (95\% confidence interval) total apparent caffeine clearance (CL) between the MA period [LCCs: 6.88 (5.61-8.16 l/h); MCCs: 10.09 (7.57-12.60 l/h)] versus the no MA period [LCCs: 6.22 (4.97-7.46 l/h); MCCs: 9.68 (7.12-12.24 l/h)]. The mean CL among HCCs (n = 5) was considerably higher in the MA period [10.48 (5.62-15.33 l/h)] compared with the no MA period [6.30 (3.40-9.20 l/h)] (P < 0.05). The decrease in CL in the no MA period among HCC appears to be due to alternative caffeine elimination pathways, rather than CYP1A2.},

Compared to mean values for Cl (2.02 +/- S.D. 0.68 ml per min per kg) and t1/2 (3.8 +/- 0.9 hr) in normal volunteers, cirrhotics were characterized by highly significant reductions in Cl (to 0.76 +/- 0.40) and prolongation in t1/2 (to 13.7 +/- 13.0), whereas the volume of distribution (VD) remained relatively unchanged (0.57 +/- 0.16 vs. 0.64 +/- 0.13 liter per kg in normals). Cumulative 14CO2 production and specific activity of 14CO2 in breath decreased in parallel (r = 0.83) with Cl. Patients with miscellaneous liver disease exhibited only small changes in Cl and t1/2; however, 14CO2 parameters in breath appeared more sensitive in indicating the slight functional derangement. In view of the correlation (Rs = 0.83) of cumulative 14CO2 excretion with the initial disappearance constant for bromosulfophthalein, the caffeine breath test may be considered as a quantitative measure of hepatic microsomal activity; based on a surprisingly close, hyperbolic relationship between Cl and fasting caffeine plasma concentrations, the latter might serve as a simple guide to severity of liver disease.},

We developed and validated a rapid and selective LC-MS/MS method for determining the plasma concentrations of 5 CYP probe drugs and metabolites (caffeine/paraxanthine, CYP1A2 substrate; losartan/losartan carboxylic acid (E3174), CYP2C9 substrate; omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole, CYP2C19 substrate; dextromethorphan/dextrorphan, CYP2D6 substrate; and midazolam/1'-hydroxymidazolam, CYP3A4 substrate) by single-step extraction, followed by a single LC-MS/MS run. An Ostro™ 96-well plate was used for extraction of CYP substrates and metabolites from human plasma and urine. Following optimization of the chromatographic conditions, all the peaks were well separated, and retention times ranged between 4.4 and 11.7 min. The total run time for a single injection was within 13 min. The accuracy and precision values suggested that the assay had high accuracy and reliability in plasma and urine samples. No significant matrix interference was observed. To demonstrate the efficacy of this method, plasma and urine concentrations of 5 CYP probe substrates and their metabolites were determined after simultaneous oral administration of 5 drugs to 4 healthy volunteers. All the substrates and metabolites were detected over an 8 h period, and the plasma concentrations of each substrate at 8 h after administration were above the lower limit of quantification. Urine concentrations of drugs and their metabolic ratio were evaluated after the administration. In conclusion, the advantage of our cocktail approach is that it enables in vivo assessment of the activity of various drug-metabolizing enzymes in a single assay.},

To identify and quantify sources of this variation, we estimated CYP1A2 activity in 863 healthy Caucasians using caffeine clearance derived from saliva concentrations before and 5-7 h after a caffeine test dose. Data from 786 individuals were eligible for evaluation (mean age 39 years, 415 women including 94 taking oral contraceptives, 401 non-smokers). Overall geometric mean (geometric SD) caffeine clearance was 1.34 ml min(-1) kg b.w.(-1) (1.65). The effect of the following covariates was evaluated by analysis of covariance: age, sex, oral contraceptives, body height, body weight, body mass index, number of cigarettes smoked, tar exposure from smoking, several indices of dietary caffeine consumption, intake of sauerkraut, and country of residence (Germany, Bulgaria or Slovakia). Estimated changes relative to arbitrarily defined basal caffeine clearance (male, non-smoking, German resident) exerted by significant (P < 0.05) covariates were: coffee, 1.45-fold per litre of coffee drunk daily; body mass index, 0.99-fold per kg m(-2); smoking, 1.22-fold, 1.47-fold, 1.66-fold, and 1.72-fold for 1-5, 6-10, 11-20, and > 20 cigarettes smoked per day, respectively; oral contraceptives, 0.72-fold; country of residence, 0.81-fold and 0.74-fold for Bulgaria and Slovakia, respectively; female, 0.90-fold. These covariates explained 37\% of overall variation. The 95\% confidence interval of individual clearance was 0.46-2.20 times the predicted value. No relevant polymorphism was found for CYP1A2 activity when adjusted for covariate effects.},

  abstract    = {Kinetic and inhibitor studies using cDNA-expressed enzymes and human liver microsomes have characterized the specificity of a range of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A substrate and inhibitor probes towards the two isoforms comprising this subfamily. Expressed CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 both catalyzed the O-deethylation of phenacetin, although the apparent Km was about 4-fold lower for CYP1A2 (25 vs. 108 microM). Phenacetin O-deethylation exhibited biphasic kinetics in human liver microsomes, and the apparent Km for the high-affinity component (9 +/- 6 microM) was consistent with the involvement of CYP1A2 in this reaction. The prototypic CYP1A xenobiotic inhibitor and substrate probes alpha-naphthoflavone, ellipticine, 7-ethoxycoumarin and 7-ethoxyresorufin all inhibited CYP1A1- and CYP1A2-mediated phenacetin O-deethylation as well as the high-affinity component of human liver phenacetin O-deethylase activity. alpha-Naphthoflavone and 7-ethoxycoumarin were, however, approximately 10-fold more potent as inhibitors of CYP1A2 than CYP1A1. Other putative human CYP1A xenobiotic substrates and inhibitors, including caffeine, 5- and 8-methoxypsoralen, nifedipine, paraxanthine, propranolol and theophylline similarly inhibited CYP1A1- and 1A2-catalyzed phenacetin O-deethylation and the high-affinity human liver phenacetin O-deethylase. In contrast, the monoclonal antibody MAb 1-7-1, raised against 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible rat cytochromes 450, almost abolished CYP1A1-mediated phenacetin O-deethylation, but had no effect on human liver microsomal- or CYP1A2-catalyzed phenacetin dealkylation. Together with previous data, the results indicate that the majority of human CYP1A xenobiotic inhibitor and substrate probes are nonspecific in their recognition of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, although selectivity is apparent for some compounds.},

  abstract    = {Caffeine (CA) N1-, N3- and N7-demethylase, CA 8-hydroxylase and phenacetin O-deethylase activities were measured in microsomes from 18 separate human livers which had been characterized previously for a range of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform-specific activities and immunoreactive CYP protein contents. Correlations between the high affinity components of the three separate CA N-demethylations were highly significant (r = 0.77-0.91, P < 0.001) and each of the three high affinity CA N-demethylations correlated significantly (r = 0.64-0.93, P < 0.05-0.001) with the high affinity phenacetin O-deethylase, 2-acetylaminofluorene N-hydroxylation and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) mutagenicity (all predominantly CYP1A2-mediated reactions). Consistent with these observations, cDNA-expressed human CYP1A2 catalyzed the N1-, N3- and N7-demethylation of CA and apparent Km values were similar (0.24-0.28 mM) for all three reactions and comparable to those observed previously with human liver microsomes. The low affinity components of CA N1- and N7-demethylation correlated significantly (r = 0.55-0.85, P < 0.05-0.001) with immunoreactive CYP2E1 content and the CYP2E1-specific activities 4-nitrophenol and chlorzoxazone hydroxylation. Diethyldithiocarbamate, a selective inhibitor of CYP2E1, inhibited the low affinity CA N1- and N7-demethylation, with IC50 values of 23 microM and 11 microM, respectively. The apparent Km values for CA N1- and N7-demethylation by cDNA-expressed CYP2E1 (namely 28 and 43 mM, respectively) were of a similar order to those calculated for the low affinity microsomal activities. Significant correlations (r = 0.87-0.97, P < 0.001) were observed between CA 8-hydroxylation and immunoreactive CYP3A content and the CYP3A-mediated reactions benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylation, omeprazole sulfoxidation and aflatoxin B1 mutagenesis. Effects of alpha-naphthoflavone, erythromycin, troleandomycin and nifedipine on microsomal CA 8-hydroxylation were generally consistent with CYP3A involvement. Taken together with previous data, the results indicate a major involvement of CYP1A2 in the high affinity component of all three human hepatic CA N-demethylations. In contrast, CYP2E1 appears to be the main enzyme involved in the low affinity components of CA N1- and N7-demethylation while CA 8-hydroxylation is catalysed predominantly by a CYP3A isoform(s).},

Thirty healthy male subjects received 100 mg caffeine, 100 mg metoprolol, 0.03 mg kg(-1) midazolam, 20 mg omeprazole and 10 mg warfarin individually and in combination (cocktail). Poor metabolizers of CYP2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 were excluded. Plasma samples were obtained up to 48 h for caffeine, metoprolol and omeprazole, 12 h for midazolam, 312 h for warfarin and the cocktail. Three different validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods were used. Noncompartmental PK parameters were calculated. Log-transformed C(max), AUC(last) and AUC for each analyte were analysed with a linear mixed effects model with fixed term for treatment, sequence and period, and random term for subject within sequence. Point estimates (90\% CI) for treatment ratios (individual/cocktail) were computed for each analyte C(max), AUC(last) and AUC.There was no PK interaction between the probe drugs when administered in combination as a cocktail, relative to the probes administered alone, as the 90\% CI of the PK parameters was within the prespecified bioequivalence limits of 0.80, 1.25.The lack of interaction between probes indicates that this cocktail could be used to evaluate the potential for multiple drug-drug interactions in vivo.},

Seven patients (8\%) who avoided caffeine consumption had nonmeasurable FPCC; they were dropped from further consideration. The remaining 79 subjects were divided into 4 diagnostic groups: surgical shunt (n = 11); alcoholic, posthepatitic, or primary biliary cirrhosis (n = 29); miscellaneous liver disease (n = 23); and normal liver (n = 16). FPCC was highest (mean, 17.8 mumol/l) in the shunt group, followed by the cirrhosis (12.3), miscellaneous liver diseases (4.6), and normal liver (2.1) groups. FPCC seemed to reflect severity of functional impairment, further supported by highly significant correlations with quantitative liver function tests, such as aminopyrine breath test (Rs = -0.89; n = 66), indocyanine green disappearance (Rs = -0.85; n = 65), and galactose elimination capacity (Rs = -0.70; n = 75). A careful dietary history showed no significant difference in caffeine consumption among the groups. It is suggested that in regular coffee drinkers FPCC might serve as a simple and convenient guide to the severity of functional impairment in chronic liver disease.},

The chromatography was performed using a C18 column with an isocratic mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.1\% formic acid in water (70:30). The triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in both positive and negative modes, and multiple reaction monitoring was used for quantification. The method was validated over the concentration ranges 0.05-5 microg/mL for caffeine and paraxanthine, 0.02-2 microg/mL for tolbutamide, 0.1-20 microg/mL for 4-hydroxytolbutamide, carboxytolbutamide, debrisoquine and 5-hydroxydebrisoquine, 5-2500 ng/mL for omeprazole and 5-hydroxyomeprazole, and 1-100 ng/mL for midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam. The intra- and inter-day precision were 0.3-13.7\% and 1.9-14.3\%, respectively, and the accuracy ranged from 93.5-107.2\%. The lower limit of quantification varied between 1 and 100 ng/mL. The present method provides a robust, fast and sensitive analytical tool for the five-probe drug cocktail, and has been successfully applied to a clinical phenotyping study in 16 subjects.},

After assessing the inhibition and recovery of CYP2D6 in a previous study, the aim of this work was to study in humans the activity of CYP1A2 in vivo after CYP2D6 had been inhibited by MDMA, using caffeine as a probe drug. Twelve male and nine female recreational MDMA users were included. In session 1, 100 mg of caffeine was given at 0 h. In session 2, a 1.5 mg/kg MDMA dose (range 75-100 mg) was given at 0 h followed by a 100 mg dose of caffeine 4 h later. Aliquots of plasma were assayed for caffeine (137X) and paraxanthine (17X) and statistically significant differences were assessed with a one-way ANOVA. There were significant gender differences at basal condition, which persisted after MDMA administration. CYP1A2 activity was higher in both genders after drug administration, with an increase in 40\% in females and 20\% in males. Results show an increase in CYP1A2 activity when CYP2D6 is inhibited by MDMA in both genders, being more pronounced in females.},

In the entire group, common and unique environmental effects explained most variation in caffeine area under the curve (AUC). Apparently, smoking and hormonal contraceptives masked the genetic effects on CYP1A2 activity. However, when excluding smokers and users of hormonal contraceptives, 89% of caffeine AUC variation was due to genetic effects and, even in the entire group, 8% of caffeine AUC variation could be explained by a CYP1A1/1A2 promotor polymorphism (rs2470893). In contrast, nearly all of the variations (99%) of NAT2 activity were explained by genetic effects. This study illustrates two very different situations in pharmacogenetics from an almost exclusively genetic determination of NAT2 activity with no environmental modulation to only moderate genetic effects on CYP1A2 activity with strong environmental modulation.},

Our study aimed to predict inter-individual variability of AUC/Dose of CYP1A2 substrates in non-smoking healthy volunteers using the Monte Carlo simulation. Inter-individual variability in hepatic intrinsic clearance of CYP1A2 substrates (CLint,h,1A2) was estimated using dispersion model based on the inter-individual variability (N = 96) of the AUC of caffeine, a major CYP1A2 substrate. The estimated coefficient of variation (CV) of CLint,h,1A2 was 55%, similar to previously reported CLint,h,2D6 (60%) but larger than CLint,h,3A4 (33%). Then, this estimated CV was validated by predicting the CVs of AUC/Dose of tizanidine and phenacetin, which are mainly metabolized by CYP1A2 and have negligible renal clearance. As a result, reported CVs were successfully predicted within 2.5-97.5 percentile range of predicted values. Moreover, CVs for AUC/Dose of the CYP1A2 substrates theophylline and lidocaine, which are affected by other CYPs and renal clearance, were also successfully predicted. The inter-individual variability of AUC/Dose of CYP1A2 substrates was successfully predicted using 55% CV for CLint,h,1A2, and the results, along with those reported by our group for other CYPs, support the prediction of inter-individual variability of pharmacokinetics in the clinical setting.},

  abstract             = {There is a high interindividual variability in cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2) activity and in its inducibility by smoking, only poorly explained by known CYP1A2 polymorphisms. We aimed to study the contribution of other regulatory pathways, including transcription factors and nuclear receptors, toward this variability. CYP1A2 activity was determined by the paraxanthine/caffeine ratio in 184 smokers and in 113 of them who were abstinent for 4 weeks. Participants were genotyped for 22 polymorphisms in 12 genes. A significant influence on CYP1A2 inducibility was observed for the NR1I3 rs2502815 (P=0.0026), rs4073054 (P=0.029), NR2B1 rs3818740 (P=0.0045), rs3132297 (P=0.036), AhR rs2282885 (P=0.040), rs2066853 (P=0.019), NR1I1 rs2228570 (P=0.037), and NR1I2 rs1523130 (P=0.044) polymorphisms. Among these, the NR1I3 rs2502815 (P=0.0045), rs4073054 (P=0.048), and NR2B1 rs3818740 (P=0.031) also influenced CYP1A2 basal activity. This is the first in-vivo demonstration of the influence of genes involved in CYP1A2 regulatory pathways on its basal activity and inducibility by smoking. These results need to be confirmed by other studies.},

We aimed to determine the interindividual change in CYP1A2 activity after smoking cessation and to relate it to CYP1A2 genetic polymorphisms. CYP1A2 activity was determined from the paraxanthine:caffeine ratio in 194 smokers and in 118 of them who had abstained from smoking during a 4-week period. The participants were genotyped for CYP1A2*1F, *1D, and *1C polymorphisms. Smokers had 1.55-fold higher CYP1A2 activity than nonsmokers (P < 0.0001). The individual change in CYP1A2 activity after smoking cessation ranged from 1.0-fold (no change) to a 7.3-fold decrease in activity. In five participants with low initial CYP1A2 activity, an increase was observed after smoking cessation. Before smoking cessation, the following factors were found to influence CYP1A2 activity: CYP1A2*1F (P = 0.005), CYP1A2*1D (P = 0.014), the number of cigarettes/day (P = 0.012), the use of contraceptives (P < 0.001), and -163A/-2467T/-3860G haplotype (P = 0.002). After quitting smoking, only CYP1A2*1F (P = 0.017) and the use of contraceptives (P = 0.05) had an influence. No influence of CYP1A2 polymorphisms on the inducibility of CYP1A2 was observed.},

  abstract             = {The enzyme CYP1A2 (cytochrome 1A2) is involved in the metabolism of certain drugs and caffeine, and its activity can be influenced by factors such as sex, age, and smoking. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs762551A>C, which has also been studied for its modifying effect on cardiovascular disease, has been reported to alter enzyme activity. The objective was to study the effect of CYP1A2, sex, age, and smoking on coffee intake. Within the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort, all coffee drinkers for whom genome-wide association data were available were selected. Because SNP rs762551 was not on the Illumina 550 platform, SNP rs2472299 was used as a proxy, with the A allele of rs762551 linked to the G allele of rs2472299. Linear regression analyses were used to determine the effect and interaction of rs2472299, sex, age, and smoking on coffee intake. Adjusted geometric means of coffee intake were calculated per genotype for the different smoking and sex strata by using multivariable general linear models. A combined analysis, with the use of a "risk score," was performed to determine the contribution of each separate factor. rs2472299G>A, female sex, and nonsmoking were significantly inversely related to coffee intake. Coffee intake was lowest in nonsmoking women homozygous for rs2472299G>A (3.49 cups/d; ∼436 mL). All factors contributed almost linearly to the intake of coffee, with the highest coffee intake in smoking men without the A allele (5.32 cups/d; ∼665 mL). rs2472299G>A, linked to rs762551A>C, sex, age, and smoking significantly contribute to coffee intake.},

Smoking-induced changes in hepatic CYP1A2 abundance were extrapolated from reported in vivo caffeine clearance data for sub-groups of a smoking population that were categorized according to their daily cigarette consumption. These abundance values together with in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) within the Simcyp population-based Simulator were used to predict the clearances of caffeine, theophylline, and clozapine in smokers. The model was used subsequently to predict differences in oral clearance between smoker and non-smoker cohorts in a Phase 1 clinical trial involving PF-2400013, a drug metabolized by CYP1A2. Estimated hepatic CYP1A2 abundance values were 52, 64, 79, 90, and 94 pmol/mg microsomal protein for subjects smoking 0, 1-5, 6-10, 11-20, and >20 cigarettes/day respectively. Predicted -fold increases in oral clearance of caffeine, theophylline and clozapine in smokers relative to non-smokers were consistent with observed data. The validated model was able to recover the smoking-induced increase in oral clearance of PF-2400013; predicted and observed mean (CV%) values in male nonsmokers and smokers were 90 L/h (40%) and 141 L/h (34%) respectively, and 100 L/h (58%) and 131 L/h (33%) respectively. This study demonstrates that it may be possible to predict the clearance of CYP1A2 substrates in smoking populations using quantitative estimates of CYP1A2 abundance based on daily cigarette consumption in conjunction with an IVIVE approach.},

Data on oral contraceptive use, habitual coffee consumption and smoking habits were obtained from 100 Serbian and 149 Swedish healthy volunteers using a detailed questionnaire. CYP1A2 activity was estimated by plasma paraxanthine/caffeine (17X/137X) ratio analysed by reversed-phase HPLC after oral administration of 100 mg caffeine. Daily consumption of at least three cups of coffee significantly increased CYP1A2 enzyme activity in both Serbs (P=0.0002) and Swedes (P<0.0001). Among non-smokers and non-OC users, heavy coffee consumption significantly increased CYP1A2 activity in Serbs (mean difference 0.11; 95% CI of the mean difference 0.04, 0.18; P=0.003) and Swedes (mean difference 0.07; 95% CI of the mean difference 0.01, 0.12; P=0.02). Significantly higher 17X/137X ratio was detected in Serbian smokers compared to non-smokers. There was no significant gender difference in CYP1A2 activity in Serbs. Controlling for the effect of smoking, heavy coffee consumption habit and oral contraceptive use, significantly lower 17X/137X ratio was observed in Serbs than in Swedes (P=0.0003). Habitual heavy coffee consumption increases CYP1A2 activity. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons formed during roasting of coffee beans might partly be responsible for this effect. The reason for the observed lower CYP1A2 activity in Serbs as compared to Swedes remains to be investigated.},

  abstract             = {The mechanisms for drug interactions with smoking and clinically significant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions with smoking are reviewed. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are some of the major lung carcinogens found in tobacco smoke. PAHs are potent inducers of the hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoenzymes 1A1, 1A2, and, possibly, 2E1. After a person quits smoking, an important consideration is how quickly the induction of CYP1A2 dissipates. The primary pharmacokinetic interactions with smoking occur with drugs that are CYP1A2 substrates, such as caffeine, clozapine, fluvoxamine, olanzapine, tacrine, and theophylline. Inhaled insulin's pharmacokinetic profile is significantly affected, peaking faster and reaching higher concentrations in smokers compared with nonsmokers, achieving significantly faster onset and higher insulin levels. The primary pharmacodynamic drug interactions with smoking are hormonal contraceptives and inhaled corticosteroids. The most clinically significant interaction occurs with combined hormonal contraceptives. The use of hormonal contraceptives of any kind in women who are 35 years or older and smoke 15 or more cigarettes daily is considered contraindicated because of the increased risk of serious cardiovascular adverse effects. The efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids may be reduced in patients with asthma who smoke. Numerous drug interactions exist with smoking. Therefore, smokers taking a medication that interacts with smoking may require higher dosages than nonsmokers. Conversely, upon smoking cessation, smokers may require a reduction in the dosage of an interacting medication.},

A population of 178 students including 19 smokers were subjected to this caffeine test to establish their P-450IA2 index. Both stated numbers of cigarettes smoked per day and urinary cotinine levels as a confirmatory measure correlated significantly with enzyme activity showing dose-effect relationships (r = 0.62 and 0.89, respectively). Nevertheless, more nonsmokers than smokers had the highest enzyme indexes, suggesting that dietary elements or other factors may determine P-450IA2 activities in populations. Because P-450IA2 is a monooxygenase that may be confined to the liver, caffeine reveals directly the Ah-receptor-dependent enzyme induction only in the liver, but it may also be a signal of induction elsewhere.},

  abstract             = {Human cytochrome P450 1A2 catalyzes important reactions in xenobiotic metabolism, including the N-hydroxylation of carcinogenic aromatic amines. In 2001, Chevalier et al. reported four new P450 1A2 sequence variants in the human population. We have now expressed these variants in Escherichia coli and measured protein expression (optical spectroscopy of holoenzyme and immunoblotting) and bioactivation of IQ (2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline) and MeIQ (2-amino-2,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline) in the lacZ reversion mutagenicity test. Enzyme kinetic analyses were performed for N-hydroxylation of five heterocyclic amine substrates and for O-deethylation of phenacetin. The most drastic effect was that of the R431W substitution: no holoenzyme was detectable. This residue is located in the "meander" peptide region and earlier site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that it is critical for maintenance of protein tertiary structure. The other three variants had subtly different catalytic activities compared to the wild-type enzyme.},

  abstract             = {Cytochrome P450 (P450) 1A2 provides an interesting paradigm for inter-individual differences in the metabolism of pro-carcinogens. The enzyme is known to vary 40-fold among individuals and may contribute to cancers caused by heterocyclic amines and other chemicals. Rat and human P450 1A2 are known to be 75% identical and were compared for several catalytic activities. The human enzyme was an order of magnitude more efficient in the N-hydroxylation of two heterocyclic amines. Further, the levels of P450 1A2 expressed in human livers show a 40-fold variation, with some as high as 0.25 nmol P450 1A2 per milligram microsomal protein. Some human liver samples are more active (than those isolated from polychlorinated biphenyl-treated rats) in the activation of heterocyclic amines. A bacterial genotoxicity assay has been developed in which human P450 1A2 and NADPH-P450 reductase are expressed within Escherichia coli and bacterial mutants can be assayed using reversion to lac prototrophy. A random mutagenesis strategy for human P450 1A2 has been developed and used to examine the changes in catalytic activity seen with many single-amino acid substitutions. These results may be of relevance in consideration of genetic polymorphisms. Further, the findings pose a challenge to molecular epidemiology effort in that results with one substrate do not necessarily predict those for others. Some dinitropyrenes are P450 1A2 substrates but others are not. 6-Nitrochrysene can be activated by human P450 1A2 but the (mono) nitropyrenes examined were not; these were oxidized by P450 3A4 instead.},

  abstract             = {The cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP1A2 mediates the rate-limiting step in the metabolism of many drugs including theophylline, clozapine, and tacrine as well as in the bioactivation of procarcinogens. CYP1A2 activity shows both pronounced intra- and interindividual variability, which is, among other factors, related to smoking causing enzyme induction, to drug intake and to dietary factors which may result in induction or inhibition. In contrast to these exogenous factors, genetic influences on enzyme activity seem to be less pronounced. Therefore, phenotyping of CYP1A2, i.e. the determination of the actual activity of the enzyme in vivo, represents a useful approach both for scientific and clinical applications. CYP1A2 is almost exclusively expressed in the liver. Since liver tissue cannot be obtained for direct phenotyping, a probe drug which is metabolized by CYP1A2 has to be given. Proposed probe drugs include caffeine, theophylline, and melatonin. Caffeine is most often used because of the predominating role of CYP1A2 in its overall metabolism and the excellent tolerability. Various urinary, plasma, saliva, and breath based CYP1A2 caffeine metrics have been applied. While caffeine clearance is considered as the gold standard, the salivary or plasma ratio of paraxanthine to caffeine in a sample taken approximately 6 hr after a defined dose of caffeine is a more convenient, less expensive but also fully validated CYP1A2 phenotyping metric. CYP1A2 phenotyping is applied frequently in epidemiologic and drug-drug interaction studies, but its clinical use and usefulness remains to be established.},

Quantitative PCR analysis was then employed to examine the interindividual variability of both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs in human liver. Hepatic content of CYP1A2 mRNA correlated significantly with levels of CYP1A2 protein as analysed by immunoblot analysis (r = 0.58; p < 0.01). CYP1A2 mRNA content varied > 40-fold among individuals while CYP1A1 content varied > 20-fold. CYP1A2 mRNA was higher than CYP1A1 mRNA (approximately two to 30-fold) in livers of different individuals. The individual with the highest CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNA amounts was a current smoker, but mRNA expression in two other smokers was within the range observed among nonsmokers. The expression of the two CYP1A mRNAs correlated highly (r = 0.72; p < 0.0005) when smokers were included, but the correlation was less significant (r = 0.62; p < 0.05) in nonsmokers. We amplified a full-length CYP1A2 cDNA clone by PCR from a liver which expressed extremely low amounts of CYP1A2 protein. Sequence analysis indicated that exon 4 was missing in this clone, but no other sequence changes were found. PCR analysis demonstrated that both the normally spliced mRNA and abnormally spliced mRNA could be detected in all human livers examined, but the normally spliced mRNA was more abundant than the splice variant. Therefore, sequence changes in the coding region of CYP1A2 did not account for the poor expression of CYP1A2 in this individual.},

  abstract             = {Coffee, a major dietary source of caffeine, is among the most widely consumed beverages in the world and has received considerable attention regarding health risks and benefits. We conducted a genome-wide (GW) meta-analysis of predominately regular-type coffee consumption (cups per day) among up to 91,462 coffee consumers of European ancestry with top single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) followed-up in ~30 062 and 7964 coffee consumers of European and African-American ancestry, respectively. Studies from both stages were combined in a trans-ethnic meta-analysis. Confirmed loci were examined for putative functional and biological relevance. Eight loci, including six novel loci, met GW significance (log10Bayes factor (BF)>5.64) with per-allele effect sizes of 0.03-0.14 cups per day. Six are located in or near genes potentially involved in pharmacokinetics (ABCG2, AHR, POR and CYP1A2) and pharmacodynamics (BDNF and SLC6A4) of caffeine. Two map to GCKR and MLXIPL genes related to metabolic traits but lacking known roles in coffee consumption. Enhancer and promoter histone marks populate the regions of many confirmed loci and several potential regulatory SNPs are highly correlated with the lead SNP of each. SNP alleles near GCKR, MLXIPL, BDNF and CYP1A2 that were associated with higher coffee consumption have previously been associated with smoking initiation, higher adiposity and fasting insulin and glucose but lower blood pressure and favorable lipid, inflammatory and liver enzyme profiles (P<5 × 10(-8)).Our genetic findings among European and African-American adults reinforce the role of caffeine in mediating habitual coffee consumption and may point to molecular mechanisms underlying inter-individual variability in pharmacological and health effects of coffee.},

Plasma concentrations and pharmacodynamics of tizanidine were measured, and a caffeine test was performed. Among nonsmokers, the peak concentration (C(max)) and area under concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity [AUC(0-infinity)] of tizanidine did not differ significantly between females and males. However, the half-life (t(1/2)) was 9% shorter in female nonsmokers than in male nonsmokers (P < 0.05). In male smokers, the t(1/2) was 10% shorter and the weight-adjusted AUC(0-infinity) 33% smaller than in male nonsmokers (P < 0.05). The caffeine/paraxanthine ratio was 35-40% smaller (P = 0.001) in male smokers than in nonsmoking males or females, but did not differ between males and females. Tizanidine lowered blood pressure and caused drowsiness significantly (P < 0.05) more in females than in either male groups. The effects on blood pressure were smallest in male smokers (P < 0.05). Gender by itself seems to have no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine, whereas smoking reduces plasma concentrations and effects of tizanidine. Any possible effect of gender and smoking is largely outweighed by individual variability in CYP1A2 activity due to genetic and environmental factors and in body weight. Careful dosing of tizanidine is warranted in small females, whereas male smokers can require higher than average doses.},

  abstract             = {This study investigated the role of genetic factors (CYP1A2) in caffeine metabolism. The CYP1A2 activity was determined in 378 Danish twins following oral intake of a single dose of 200 mg caffeine and subsequent determination of the caffeine ratio (AFMU+1MU+1MX)/17DMU in a 6-h urine sample. The mean (+/- SD) caffeine ratio was 5.9 +/- 3.4. The caffeine ratio was statistically significantly higher in men compared to women, in smoking men and women compared to non-smoking persons of the same gender and in women not taking oral contraceptives compared with women on oral contraceptives. Thus, we confirmed that CYP1A2 is more active in men than in women, that it is induced by smoking and inhibited by oral contraceptives. In the subsequent analysis of heritability, we included 49 monozygotic twin pairs and 34 same gender dizygotic twin pairs concordant for non-smoking and non-use of oral contraceptives. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.798 (95% confidence interval, 0.696-0.900) and 0.394 (95% confidence interval, 0.109-0.680) in the monozygotic and dizygotic twins, respectively. The correlation was statistically significantly higher (P = 0.0015) in the former compared with the latter. A biometrical model for the caffeine ratio including only additive genetic factors and unique environmental factors was the overall best fitting model. Estimates based on this model gave a heritability estimate of 0.725 (95% confidence interval 0.577-0.822). Unique environmental effects seem to account for the remainder 0.275 (95% confidence interval, 0.178-0.423). Our study shows that the CYP1A2 activity is mainly governed by genetic factors.},

No significant difference was noted in the apparent volume of distribution in smokers (720 +/- 67 ml . kg-1) and nonsmokers (610 +/- 80 ml . kg-1). These differences probably reflect the induction of hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity in smokers.

  abstract             = {1. In previous studies (Boobis et al., 1985b) it was shown that a monoclonal antibody (MAb 3/4/2), raised against rat cytochrome P450 form c, reacts with an isoenzyme(s) of cytochrome P450 in human liver. It was predicted that the epitope with which this antibody reacts should be present on both isoenzymes of the P450IA gene sub-family (the orthologues of forms c and d) in man (Edwards et al., 1987). 2. This antibody was used to probe 45 different samples of human liver, by the technique of Western blotting. With one exception, all of the samples contained immunoreactive protein, a single band at Mr 54,000 (orthologous to rat form d), which ranged in content from less than 0.5 to 33.5 pmol mg-1 microsomal protein. The content of the human orthologue of form c was below 0.5 pmol mg-1, the limit of detection of the assay. 3. Thirteen of the samples were from patients of known smoking status. Immunoreactive P450 content was 3.5-fold higher, and phenacetin O-deethylase activity was four-fold higher, in the smokers than in the non-smokers. 4. There was a highly significant correlation between the amount of immunoreactive cytochrome P450 and the high affinity component of phenacetin O-deethylase activity in both smokers and non-smokers. 5. It is concluded that the high affinity component of phenacetin O-deethylase activity in man is catalysed by the orthologue of rat cytochrome P450d, and that this isoenzyme is inducible by cigarette smoking. 6. In a number of previous publications it has been suggested that there is an association between the poor metaboliser (PM) phenotype for debrisoquine and impaired phenacetin O-deethylation. In the present study it was shown that not all subjects PM for debrisoquine are poor metabolisers of phenacetin.},

  abstract             = {Caffeine metabolism via the 3-demethylation pathway is sequentially catalyzed by cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2), xanthine oxidase, and N-acetyltransferase. The activities of the three enzymes can be estimated from urinary metabolic ratios of four caffeine metabolites, 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil (AFMU), 1-methyluric acid (1MU), 1-methylxanthine (1MX), and 1,7-dimethyluric acid (17DMU), after the ingestion of caffeine. A method for quantitation of the four metabolites in human urine has been developed. The method is based on a one-step extraction with ethyl acetate/2-propanol followed by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. The detection limit was 1 microM for AFMU, 1MU, and 1MX and 2 microM for 17DMU. The intraday and interday coefficients of variation were < 3% and < 7%, respectively, and the accuracy was within +/- 3%. The method was employed in a population study of 277 healthy volunteers, each of whom ingested 200 mg caffeine and provided a urine sample approximately 6 h later. The metabolite concentration ranges in the urines were 2.1-327 microM, 4.0-744 microM, 4.9-598 microM, and 6.4-260 microM for AFMU, 1MU, 1MX, and 17DMU, respectively. The CYP1A2 ratio (AFMU + 1MU + 1MX/17DMU) was significantly lower in women than in men, excluding smokers and oral contraceptive users. The CYP1A2 ratio was higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, confirming the induction of CYP1A2 by smoking. In women using oral contraceptives, the CYP1A2 ratio was, as expected, significantly lower than in women not using oral contraceptives. For the N-acetyltransferase ratio (AFMU/1MX) and the xanthine oxidase ratio (1MU/1MX), no differences were seen in terms of sex, smoking habits, or the use of oral contraceptives. All results are in agreement with previous reports on CYP1A2, N-acetyltransferase, and xanthine oxidase activities in humans. Thus, the method is both analytically and biologically reliable for the assessment of CYP1A2, N-acetyltransferase, and xanthine oxidase in humans.},

  abstract             = {Cigarette smoking remains highly prevalent in most countries. It can affect drug therapy by both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms. Enzymes induced by tobacco smoking may also increase the risk of cancer by enhancing the metabolic activation of carcinogens. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in tobacco smoke are believed to be responsible for the induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1, CYP1A2 and possibly CYP2E1, CYP1A1 is primarily an extrahepatic enzyme found in lung and placenta. There are genetic polymorphisms in the inducibility of CYP1A1, with some evidence that high inducibility is more common in patients with lung cancer. CYP1A2 is a hepatic enzyme responsible for the metabolism of a number of drugs and activation of some procarcinogens. Caffeine demethylation, using blood clearance or urine metabolite data, has been used as an in vivo marker of CYP1A2 activity, clearly demonstrating an effect of cigarette smoking, CYP2E1 metabolises a number of drugs as well as activating some carcinogens. Our laboratory has found in an intraindividual study that cigarette smoking significantly enhances CYP2E1 activity as measured by the clearance of chlorzoxazone. In animal studies, nicotine induces the activity of several enzymes, including CYP2E1, CYP2A1/2A2 and CYP2B1/2B2, in the brain, but whether this effect is clinically significant is unknown. Similarly, although inhibitory effects of the smoke constituents carbon monoxide and cadmium on CYP enzymes have been observed in vitro and in animal studies, the relevance of this inhibition to humans has not yet been established. The mechanism involved in most interactions between cigarette smoking and drugs involves the induction of metabolism. Drugs for which induced metabolism because of cigarette smoking may have clinical consequence include theophylline, caffeine, tacrine, imipramine, haloperidol, pentazocine, propranolol, flecainide and estradiol. Cigarette smoking results in faster clearance of heparin, possibly related to smoking-related activation of thrombosis with enhanced heparin binding to antithrombin III. Cutaneous vasoconstriction by nicotine may slow the rate of insulin absorption after subcutaneous administration. Pharmacodynamic interactions have also been described. Cigarette smoking is associated with a lesser magnitude of blood pressure and heart rate lowering during treatment with beta-blockers, less sedation from benzodiazepines and less analgesia from some opioids, most likely reflecting the effects of the stimulant actions of nicotine. The impact of cigarette smoking needs to be considered in planning and assessing responses to drug therapy. Cigarette smoking should be specifically studied in clinical trials of new drugs.},

  abstract             = {To investigate the CYP1A2 phenotype distribution in a population with an increased exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that would likely induce an increased activity of this enzyme. Further, to investigate the effect of sex, smoking, and oral contraceptive use on the CYP1A2 activity. In 305 randomly selected Faroese residents aged 18-60 years, the CYP1A2 activity was determined following oral intake of a caffeine dose and subsequent determination of the urinary metabolites and calculation of the caffeine metabolic ratio (CMR). PCB exposure was assessed by measuring the serum concentration of major congeners. The CYP1A2 phenotype distribution was unimodal. The CMR was significantly higher both in smoking men and in smoking women, independent of oral contraceptive use, as compared with non-smokers. Among non-smokers, the CMR was significantly higher in women not using oral contraceptives than in those using oral contraceptives; a similar difference could not be established among smokers. The CMR appeared higher in men than in women, but stratified analyses confirmed a significant sex-related difference only among smokers not using oral contraceptives. Overall, the mean CMR in Faroese was significantly higher compared with the mean CMR in Danish historical controls. No association was found with PCB exposure and individual PCB congeners, except for one of three dioxin-like congeners, in confounder-adjusted multiple regression analyses. The CYP1A2 phenotype in Faroese residents was unimodally distributed and showed the inducing effect of smoking and the inhibiting effect of use of oral contraceptives, but a sex-related difference was not apparent after confounder adjustment. There was no statistically significant association between CMR and PCB exposure.},

A cohort of volunteers comprising 192 individuals (96 males, 96 females) was divided into subgroups according to smoking and/or use of oral contraceptives. The CYP1A2 substrate caffeine was administered, and urine was collected for 6 h and analysed for representative caffeine metabolites. Distribution of a CYP1A2-dependent MRc was analysed using cumulative distribution (probit) plots and Rosin-Rammler-Sperling-Weibull (RRSW) functions. Cumulative distribution curves for males, and females, without further subgrouping for smoking habits and/or oral contraceptive steroid (OCS) consumption, showed slightly higher MRc values, i.e. slightly higher CYP1A2 activities, in males. Significantly higher MRc values were found in smokers of both sexes than in non-smokers. The distributions among female non-smokers or smokers with and without OCS were nearly super-imposible, however. For the two male subgroups, the sum of two RRSW functions resulted in a better adjustment to the data than a unimodal skewed distribution. A weak correlation between MRc and the number of cigarettes smoked per day was found. The inducing effect of smoking on CYP1A2 activity was confirmed, whereas no significant inhibitory effect of oral contraceptives was observed. The finding that the data are compatible with bimodal distributions in non-smokers suggests a significant impact of genetic factors on MRc. Among smokers, data were also compatible with bimodal distributions, i.e. with the existence of a "non-responder" phenotype concerning CYP1A2 induction by compounds present in tobacco smoke.},

Nonblind, single-dose clinical investigation in 34 non-related adult Bulgarian Caucasians (18 women and 16 men, aged between 18 and 62 years) with normal and reduced renal function. Each participant received oral caffeine 3 mg/kg. Two blood samples per individual were taken according to the protocol for measuring caffeine plasma concentrations. A total of 67 measured concentrations were used to obtain NPEM estimates of caffeine clearance. Paraxanthine/caffeine plasma ratios were calculated and correlated with clearance estimates. Graphical methods and tests for normality were applied and parametric and nonparametric statistical tests were used for comparison. NPEM median estimates of caffeine absorption and elimination rate constants, k(a) = 4.54 h(-1) and k(el) = 0.139 h(-1), as well as of fractional volume of distribution and plasma clearance, V(S1) = 0.58 L/kg and CL(S1) = 0.057 L/h/kg, agreed well with reported values from more 'data rich' studies. Significant correlations were observed between paraxanthine/caffeine ratios at 3, 8 and 10 hours and clearance (Spearman rank correlation coefficients, r(s), >0.74, p </= 0.04). Sex or renal function caused no significant differences in clearance. Heavy smokers and drinkers showed 2-fold higher CYP1A2 activity. Normality tests and graphical methods of analysing caffeine clearance supported a non-Gaussian and multicomponent distribution of CYP1A2 activity. Collectively, the results show that the NPEM method is suitable and relevant for large-scale epidemiological studies of population phenotyping for cancer susceptibility and for abnormal liver function by monitoring CYP1A2 activity based on sparse caffeine data.},

Abstinence from smoking for 4 days resulted in a 46% increase in the 24-hour AUC. Thus, significant, although probably not complete, normalization of the enzyme-inducing effects of cigarette smoking can be seen after 4 days abstinence. During abstinence, 24-hour urine ratios of dimethylxanthines to caffeine and mono-dimethylxanthines to dimethylxanthines were reduced, suggesting that cigarette smoking accelerates both demethylation steps. Other metabolic pathways were unaffected.},

We studied in smokers the influence of four days of multiple daily doses of coffee containing different doses or no caffeine on cigarette smoking behavior, nicotine intake from smoking, heart rate and blood pressure, circadian serum glucose, and urinary catecholamine excretion. We observed a tendency toward greater cigarette consumption during caffeine consumption, and a tendency toward higher plasma nicotine levels during low-dose caffeine compared with the no-caffeine condition; however, these effects were small. No caffeine effects on any other of the above parameters were observed. Previously published research has usually studied effects of single doses of caffeine, which does not account for development of tolerance to effects of caffeine.

In the metabolism of caffeine, the conversion of 1,7 dimethylxanthine (17X) to 1,7 dimethiylurate (17U) is catalyzed primarily by CYP2A6. CYP2A6 phenotype was determined by the urinary ratio 17U:17X in the interval of 4-5 h after caffeine intake in 179 healthy white Spaniards (102 women and 76 men). There were 99 non-smokers and 80 smokers. Among women, 26 were taking oral contraceptives. The age was the most important predictive factor of CYP2A6 activity (P < 0.001) with older subjects having higher activity. The influence of the gender was more modest (P = 0.07) with women exhibiting borderline increased values of the CYP2A6 marker than men. Tobacco smoking did not affect CYP2A6 activity. However, the CYP2A6 marker resulted to be strongly related to the use of oral contraceptives. The women users of oral contraceptives had higher values of CYP2A6 marker than both women not taking oral contraceptives and men (P < 0.001 in both comparisons). The results indicate that age, oral contraceptive use, and possibly gender should be controlled in epidemiological studies dealing with CYP2A6 activity and its relationship with xenobiotics exposure and genetic or pathological factor.},

  abstract        = {To assess the effect of gender, age, and smoking habits on the in vivo activities of CYP1A2, flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO), and xanthine oxidase in Korean subjects. One hundred thirty-three age- and gender-matched healthy Korean volunteers (age range, 21 to 78 years; mean age, 35.3 +/- 16.6 years) with and without smoking habits participated. After drinking a cup of coffee (200 mL) that contained 110 mg caffeine, a 1-hour urine sample (between 4 and 5 hours) was collected and caffeine metabolites were analyzed by HPLC. There were marked individual variations in CYP1A2 [(1,7-dimethylurate + paraxanthine)/caffeine], FMO (theobromine/caffeine), and xanthine oxidase (1-methylurate/1-methylxanthine) activities (14-, 42-, and 9-fold, respectively). However, the mean values of these enzyme activities in the nonsmokers were not different between men and women. In the nonsmoking subjects in their 20s, the mean values of CYP1A2 and FMO activities (13.5 +/- 5.9 and 2.1 +/- 1.9, respectively) were higher than those (7.9 +/-1.8 and 0.95 +/- 0.22) of older decennial age groups. Xanthine oxidase activities were the same for all age groups (subjects in their 20s through their 70s). CYP1A2 activity of the smokers (20.0 +/- 9.6) was higher than that of the nonsmokers (10.8 +/- 5.8; P < .001). Similarly, the FMO activity in smokers (3.4 +/- 2.7) was higher than that of the nonsmokers (1.8 +/- 1.7; P < .001). The xanthine oxidase activity (1.3 +/- 0.5) was not increased in smokers (1.4 +/- 0.5; P = .46). Results of this caffeine metabolism study conducted with age- and gender-matched healthy Korean volunteers with and without smoking habits provided the baseline and the widely varying interindividual activities of CYP1A2, FMO, and xanthine oxidase in a Korean population. The results also suggested that drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 and FMO may require individualized dose adjustment according to the age and smoking habits of the subjects.},

Analysis of urinary metabolites was undertaken in a larger population to assess the effects of gender, age, oral contraceptives, and smoking on the ratio. No gender differences were observed in either adults or children; children (n = 21) showed a higher (P less than 0.001) mean metabolite ratio than adults (n = 61), oral contraceptive users (n = 9) had lower (P less than 0.05) ratios than women not taking oral contraceptives (n = 30), and smokers (n = 26) had higher (P less than 0.001) ratios than nonsmokers (n = 61).

  abstract        = {Paraxanthine (PX; 1,7-dimethylxanthine) is the major metabolite of caffeine in humans. Despite the continuous exposure of a large proportion of the population to PX, little is known about PX disposition in humans. The present study was performed to define the metabolic partial clearances of PX in humans and, by determining the effects of cimetidine and allopurinol pretreatments on PX disposition, assess the relative importance of cytochrome P-450 and xanthine oxidase in PX biotransformation. The combined formation of the 7-demethylated products 1-methylxanthine (1-MX), 1-methyluric acid (1-MU) and 5-acetyl-amino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil (AFMU) accounted for 67% of PX clearance. Formation of 7-methylxanthine (7-MX) and 1,7-dimethyluric acid and renal excretion of unchanged PX comprised 6, 8 and 9% of PX clearance, respectively. Allopurinol pretreatment had no effect on PX plasma clearance but decreased 1-MU excretion and increased 1-MX excretion, with the combined excretion of these metabolites remaining constant. Cimetidine pretreatment decreased PX plasma clearance by 30%. Metabolic partial clearances to 1-MX + 1-MU and to AFMU were reduced to a similar extent (ca. 40%) in the cimetidine treatment phase, but other pathways were not significantly affected. These data are consistent with 1-MX and AFMU being derived from a common intermediate, the formation of which is mediated by cytochrome P-450. Xanthine oxidase catalyzes only the secondary conversion of 1-MX to 1-MU.},

Twelve cigarette smokers were studied in 3 treatment conditions, each lasting 7 days, during which they smoked cigarettes, breathed carbon monoxide to achieve carboxyhemoglobin levels similar to those associated with cigarette smoking, or breathed air. In each treatment condition, subjects received oral chlorzoxazone (250 mg) and caffeine (250 mg) with measurement of disposition kinetics and urine metabolite profiles. Compared with the air condition, cigarette smoking significantly induced the metabolism of chlorzoxazone (oral clearance, 5.9 +/- 1.5 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) versus 4.8 +/- 1.0 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1), P <.005) and caffeine (2.0 +/- 0.8 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) versus 1.5 +/- 0.7 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1), P <.001) but had no effect on caffeine urine metabolite ratios that reflect xanthine oxidase and N-acetyltransferase-2 activity. Considerable individual variability was noted in the extent of induction of metabolism by cigarette smoking, particularly as it affects chlorzoxazone (change in oral clearance ranged from -10% to +71%). Carbon monoxide had no effect on chlorzoxazone or caffeine metabolism or caffeine metabolic profile. This study provides novel evidence that cigarette smoking accelerates chlorzoxazone metabolism, most likely reflecting induction of CYP2E1 activity, in humans. Induction of CYP2E1 activity by cigarette smoking could contribute to tobacco-induced cancer, alcohol-induced liver disease, and the risk of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity.},

CYP1A2 alone was responsible for caffeine 3-demethylation and paraxanthine 7-demethylation; in addition, 1A2 catalysed virtually all reactions related to caffeine and its metabolites. The metabolic profile of caffeine biotransformation by CYP1A2 averaged 81.5% for paraxanthine, 10.8% for theobromine and 5.4% for theophylline formation. It remained quite uniform when caffeine concentrations were varied. The most striking finding was that CYP2E1 (the ethanol-inducible form) had major influences upon caffeine metabolism: in particular, it catalysed the formation of theophylline and theobromine from caffeine. Thus, the in vivo metabolite profiling of caffeine may reveal CYP2E1 activities in addition to the previously documented activities of CYP1A2, polymorphic N-acetyltransferase and xanthine oxidase.},

  abstract        = {The molecular basis for the use of caffeine (CA; 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) as a probe for specific human cytochromes P450 has been investigated. The CA 1-, 3- and 7-demethylations (to form theobromine, paraxanthine and theophylline, respectively) all followed biphasic kinetics in human liver microsomes. Mean apparent Km values for the high- and low-affinity components of the demethylations ranged from 0.13-0.31 nM and 19.2-30.0 mM, respectively. cDNA-expressed CYP1A2 catalysed all three CA demethylations, and the apparent Km for CA 3-demethylation (the major metabolic pathway in humans) by the expressed enzyme was similar to the Km for the high-affinity liver microsomal CA 3-demethylase. IC50 values for inhibition of the CA demethylations by alpha-naphthoflavone were similar for both expressed CYP1A2 and the high-affinity microsomal demethylases. Moreover, CA was a competitive inhibitor of expressed CYP1A2 catalysed phenacetin O-deethylation, with the apparent Ki (0.080 mM) closely matching the apparent Km (0.082 mM) for CA 3-demethylation by the expressed enzyme. Expressed CYP1A1 was additionally shown to catalyse the 3-demethylation of CA, although activity was lower than that observed for CYP1A2. While these data indicate that CYP1A2 is responsible for the high-affinity component of human liver CA 3-demethylation, two limitations associated with the use of CA as an in vitro probe for CYP1A2 activity have been identified: (i) CA 3-demethylation reflects hepatic CYP1A2 activity only at appropriately low substrate concentrations; and (ii) CA is a non-specific CYP1A substrate and CYP1A1 may therefore contribute to CA 3-demethylase activity in tissues in which it is expressed. An anti-CYP3A antibody essentially abolished the 8-hydroxylation of CA to form trimethyluric acid, suggesting formation of this metabolite may potentially serve as a marker of CYP3A isozyme(s) activity.},

The results obtained using rat cDNA-expressed P450s indicated that 8-hydroxylation was the main oxidation pathway of caffeine (70%) in the rat. CYP1A2 was found to be a key enzyme catalyzing 8-hydroxylation (72%) and substantially contributing to 3-N-demethylation (47%) and 1-N-demethylation (37.5%) at a caffeine concentration of 0.1mM (relevant to "the maximum therapeutic concentration in humans"). Furthermore, CYP2C11 considerably contributed to 3-N-demethylation (31%). The CYP2C subfamily (66%) - mainly CYP2C6 (27%) and CYP2C11 (29%) - played a major role in catalyzing 7-N-demethylation. At higher substrate concentrations, the contribution of CYP1A2 to the metabolism of caffeine decreased in favor of CYP2C11 (N-demethylations) and CYP3A2 (mainly 8-hydroxylation). The obtained results were confirmed with liver microsomes (inhibition and correlation studies). Therefore, caffeine may be used as a marker substance for assessing the activity of CYP1A2 in rats, using 8-hydroxylation (but not 3-N-demethylation-like in humans); moreover, caffeine may also be used to simultaneously, preliminarily estimate the activity of CYP2C using 7-N-demethylation as a marker reaction. Hence caffeine pharmacokinetics in rats may be changed by drugs affecting the activity of CYP1A2 and/or CYP2C, e.g. by some antidepressants.},

The experiments were carried out in vitro using cDNA-expressed P450s, liver microsomes and specific P450 inhibitors. The obtained results show that (1) apart from the 3-N-demethylation of caffeine - a CYP1A2 marker reaction and the main oxidation pathway of caffeine in man - 1-N-demethylation is also specifically catalyzed by CYP1A2 (not reported previously); (2) 7-N-demethylation is catalyzed non-specifically, mainly by CYP1A2 and, to a smaller extent, by CYP2C8/9 and CYP3A4 (and not by CYP2E1, as suggested previously); (3) C-8-hydroxylation preferentially involves CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 and, to a smaller degree, CYP2C8/9 and CYP2E1 (and not only CYP3A, as suggested previously) at a concentration of 100 microM corresponding to the maximum therapeutic concentration in humans. At a higher caffeine concentration, the contribution of CYP1A2 to this reaction decreases in favour of CYP2C8/9. The obtained data show for the first time the contribution of CYP2C isoforms to the metabolism of caffeine in human liver and suggest that apart from 3-N-demethylation, 1-N-demethylation may also be used for testing CYP1A2 activity.

All these activities were highly significantly intercorrelated (r greater than 0.72, p less than 0.001) and correlated with the level of immunoreactive P-450IA2 content (r greater than 0.65; p less than 0.001). P-450IA content was measured by immunoblotting with anti-rat P-450 beta-naphthoflavone-B, an antibody that detects only a single band corresponding to P-450IA2. The formation rate of two caffeine metabolites, namely paraxathine and theobromine, was correlated with the four monooxygenase activities measured and P-450IA2-specific content (r greater than 0.75). However, inhibition studies of caffeine metabolism by phenacetin, a specific substrate of P-450IA2, clearly indicated that only the N-3 demethylation of caffeine was supported by this enzyme. These in vitro data demonstrate that P-450IA2 is predominantly responsible for the major metabolic pathway of caffeine and that the formation of other demethylated metabolites is mediated, at least partly, by other P-450 enzymes.},

  abstract        = {The cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP1A2 metabolises several drugs and carcinogens. We wanted to determine how much of the variability of CYP1A2 activity is explained by a newly discovered gene polymorphism in intron 1. A single nucleotide polymorphism in intron 1 of the CYP1A2 gene at position 734 downstream of the first transcribed nucleotide was identified by DNA sequence analysis. The functional significance of this C/A polymorphism was assessed in 185 healthy Caucasian non-smokers and in 51 smokers by genotyping and phenotyping using caffeine (100 mg oral dose). Out of the total sample, 46% were homozygous for the variant A, 44% were heterozygous, and 10% were homozygous for the variant C. The ratio of 1,7-dimethylxanthine (17X) plus 1,7-dimethyluric acid divided by caffeine in 0-5 h urine samples from 185 non-smokers did not differ significantly between the three CYP1A2 genotypes. In the 51 smokers, analysis of variance revealed significant differences in the 5 h plasma 17X/caffeine ratios between the genotypes (P=0.008, F-test). The mean ratio was 1.37 in carriers of the A/A genotype, 0.88 in heterozygotes and 0.82 in carriers of C/C. The mean difference between the A/A and C/A groups was 0.48 (95% confidence interval 0. 15-0.81; P=0.01). The A/A genotype, which may represent a CYP1A2 high inducibility genotype, may either be a direct cause of increased CYP1A2 activity, or be genetically linked to polymorphisms conferring high inducibility. Further studies are needed to define the role of this polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolised by CYP1A2 and in the activation of carcinogens.},

  abstract        = {Fasting plasma caffeine concentration and various parameters of caffeine elimination from plasma obtained after a standardized oral dose of 140 mg caffeine have been compared in nine patients with liver cirrhosis, eight patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease and ten healthy volunteers with regard to their ability to discriminate between the different groups. Fasting plasma caffeine concentrations were significantly higher in cirrhotics (11.1 +/- 10.5 mumol/l) than in healthy volunteers (1.5 +/- 0.8 mumol/l). The respective values measured in patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease (3.1 +/- 3.1 mumol/l) did not differ significantly from the controls. Plasma disappearance rate and clearance of caffeine were significantly decreased in cirrhotics (0.11 +/- 0.02 h-1; 1.0 +/- 0.3 ml/min per kg) and in patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease (0.18 +/- 0.04 h-1; 2.2 +/- 0.7 ml/min per kg) as compared to healthy volunteers (0.23 +/- 0.04 h-1; 3.1 +/- 0.9 ml/min per kg). Plasma caffeine concentration determined 12 h after administration of the test dosage discriminated best between patients with cirrhosis (5.4 +/- 1.6 mumol/l), patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease (2.0 +/- 1.4 mumol/l) and healthy volunteers (0.8 +/- 0.2 mumol/l). These results, the safety of the test compound and the simplicity of a single caffeine determination in plasma 12 h after a standardized dose of caffeine make this test attractive for evaluation of liver function.},

To assess the amounts and types of these human cytochromes P-450, we incubated theophylline with microsomes prepared from 22 different human livers in the presence of NADPH, and measured simultaneous rates of 1- and 3-N-demethylations to 3-methylxanthine (3-MX) and 1-methylxanthine (1-MX), respectively; and 8-hydroxylation to 1,3-dimethyluric acid (1,3-DMU). Under optimal conditions, 3-MX, 1-MX, and 1,3-DMU formation proceeded with mean Km values of 2.05, 1.93, and 5.34 mM and Vmax values of 2.28, 2.48, and 23.4 pmol/mg/min, respectively. Formation of 3-MX and 1-MX correlated best with amounts of the immunoreactive protein HLd (P-450IA2) (p less than 0.05), whereas formation of 1,3-DMU correlated with the microsomal content of HLp (P-450IIIA3) and HLj (P-450IIE1). In immunoinhibition experiments, incubations conducted with a polyclonal anti-rat P-450c/d antibody, the formation of all the three theophylline metabolites (p less than 0.05) was significantly inhibited. However, addition of isoform-specific anti-rat-P-450d antibodies to the microsomal mixture significantly inhibited 1-N-demethylation, selectively, with little (if any) inhibition of 3-N-demethylation or 8-hydroxylation. Nonspecific cytochrome P-450 inhibition was ruled out by showing that erythromycin N-demethylation, an activity catalyzed by HLp, was unaffected by either anti-P-450c/d (P-450IA1/IA2) or anti-P-450d. Anti-rat-P-450p antibodies failed to block formation of theophylline metabolism, but did inhibit erythromycin N-demethylase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract        = {Studies were undertaken to determine which human P450 enzymes catalyze the metabolism of theophylline to 1,3-dimethyluric acid (1,3-DU), to facilitate predictions of theophylline drug-drug interactions, and to develop a noninvasive test for human P4501A2. Microsomes from a human cell line transfected individually with human P450 cDNAs for P4501A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4 were used to demonstrate that only P4501A2 exhibited catalytic activity for theophylline metabolism to 1,3-DU with high affinity and low capacity (Km = 0.6 mM, Vmax = 37.8, pmol/min/mg), while P4502D6, 2E1, and 3A4 (Km = 14.4, 19.9, and 25.1 mM, respectively, and Vmax = 219.8, 646.4, and 20.8 pmol/min/mg, respectively) exhibited activities with low affinity and variable capacities. Correlations of rates of theophylline 8-hydroxylation to 1,3-DU with other P450 form-specific activities, in a series of ten human liver microsomal preparations, at 5 and 40 mM theophylline concentrations, revealed that at low concentrations the metabolism was catalyzed primarily by P4501A2, while at high substrate concentrations P4502E1 was primarily responsible for catalysis. The results with individually expressed P450s and hepatic microsomal preparations were consistent, indicating that the former system provides a qualitatively accurate reflection of the function of the heterogeneously expressed liver P450s. At pharmacologic theophylline concentrations achieved in vivo, its metabolism must thus be catalyzed primarily by P4501A2.},

Health care providers are urged to facilitate smoking cessation for patients who smoke, but the effects of smoking cessation on the metabolism of some drugs is not routinely considered. A comprehensive literature review. The review was conducted in 2008 using a computerised drug interaction program and multiple PubMed and CINAHL searches to identify prescription drugs with clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic changes caused by smoking cessation. Although much of the evidence is case report, dosage adjustments are clearly indicated for warfarin, olanzapine, clozapine and theophylline since they are metabolised by cytochrome P450 CYP1A2 and also have narrow therapeutic ratios. Careful monitoring is recommended for other CYP1A2 metabolised drugs, including those for hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. For many affected drugs, smoking cessation reverses smoking-induced CYP1A2 hepatic enzyme levels to normal, increasing plasma concentrations in patients whose dose was established while smoking. Because the effect on hepatic microsomal enzymes is not related to the nicotine component of tobacco, nicotine replacement will not alter the effect. The effects of smoking cessation on drugs metabolised by CYP1A2 have been under-appreciated by health care providers. Smoking cessation may increase plasma levels of some drugs to potentially toxic levels. Further research is warranted to clarify this effect. When patients stop smoking, providers should carefully review prescribed drug regimens and adjust or monitor drugs whose metabolism is affected by smoking cessation. This is particularly important for patients who abruptly stop smoking due to hospitalisation and for older patients who are likely to be taking multiple medications.},

These enzymes are therefore important in pharmacologic and toxicologic studies, and information on their abundances is of value in the process of scaling in vitro data to in vivo metabolic parameters. A meta-analysis was applied to data on the abundance of human hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes in Caucasian adult livers (50 studies). Despite variations in the methods used to measure the abundance of enzymes, agreement between the studies in 26 different laboratories was generally good. Nonetheless, some heterogeneity was detected (Higgins and Thompson heterogeneity test). More importantly, large interindividual variability was observed in the collated data. Positive correlations between the expression levels of some cytochrome P450 enzymes were found in the abundance data, including the following pairs: CYP3A4/CYP3A5*1/*3 (Rs = 0.70, P < 0.0001, n = 52), CYP3A4/CYP2C8 (Rs = 0.68, P < 0.0001, n = 134), CYP3A4/CYP2C9 (Rs = 0.55, P < 0.0001, n = 71), and CYP2C8/CYP2C9 (Rs = 0.55, P < 0.0001, n = 99).

Outcome measures were BP, caffeine intake, CYP1A2 activity and polymorphisms rs762551, rs1133323 and rs1378942. CYP1A2 variants were associated with hypertension in non-smokers, but not in smokers (CYP1A2-smoking interaction P = 0.01). Odds ratios (95% CIs) for hypertension for rs762551 CC, CA and AA genotypes were 1 (reference), 0.78 (0.59-1.02) and 0.66 (0.50-0.86), respectively, P = 0.004. Results were similar for the other variants. Higher CYP1A2 activity was linearly associated with lower BP after quitting smoking (P = 0.049 and P = 0.02 for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively), but not while smoking. In non-smokers, the CYP1A2 variants were associated with higher reported caffeine intake, which in turn was associated with lower odds of hypertension and lower BP (P = 0.01). In Mendelian randomization analyses using rs1133323 as instrument, each cup of caffeinated beverage was negatively associated with systolic BP [-9.57 (-16.22, -2.91) mmHg]. The associations of CYP1A2 variants with BP were modified by reported caffeine intake. These observational and quasi-experimental results strongly support a causal role of CYP1A2 in BP control via caffeine intake.},

  abstract        = {Clozapine (CLO), an atypical antipsychotic, depends mainly on cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) for its metabolic clearance. Four patients treated with CLO, who were smokers, were nonresponders and had low plasma levels while receiving usual doses. Their plasma levels to dose ratios of CLO (median; range, 0.34; 0.22 to 0.40 ng x day/mL x mg) were significantly lower than ratios calculated from another study with 29 patients (0.75; 0.22 to 2.83 ng x day/mL x mg; P < 0.01). These patients were confirmed as being CYP1A2 ultrarapid metabolizers by the caffeine phenotyping test (median systemic caffeine plasma clearance; range, 3.85; 3.33 to 4.17 mL/min/kg) when compared with previous studies (0.3 to 3.33 mL/min/kg). The sequencing of the entire CYP1A2 gene from genomic DNA of these patients suggests that the -164C > A mutation (CYP1A2*1F) in intron 1, which confers a high inducibility of CYP1A2 in smokers, is the most likely explanation for their ultrarapid CYP1A2 activity. A marked (2 patients) or a moderate (2 patients) improvement of the clinical state of the patients occurred after the increase of CLO blood levels above the therapeutic threshold by the increase of CLO doses to very high values (ie, up to 1400 mg/d) or by the introduction of fluvoxamine, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor, at low dosage (50 to 100 mg/d). Due to the high frequency of smokers among patients with schizophrenia and to the high frequency of the -164C > A polymorphism, CYP1A2 genotyping could have important clinical implications for the treatment of patients with CLO.},

  abstract        = {Cytochrome CYP1A2, a liver enzyme responsible for the metabolic activation of a number of putative human carcinogens, exhibits wide inter-individual differences in activity. In order to characterize sources of variability in CYP1A2 activity, we phenotyped (with the caffeine test) 90 subjects of various ethnic backgrounds in Hawaii. Forty-three subjects were patients with in-situ colorectal cancer treated by polypectomy and 47 were healthy population controls. Subjects were also administered a detailed lifestyle questionnaire, including a quantitative food frequency questionnaire, and were assessed for plasma levels of carotenoids, tocopherols, retinol, ascorbic acid, cholesterol and triglycerides. In a stepwise multiple regression, 27% of the overall variation in CYP1A2 activity was explained by seven variables. Plasma lutein explained the largest portion of the variance (7%) and was negatively associated with CYP1A2 activity (p < 0.01), as were use of menopausal replacement estrogens (p = 0.04), plasma alpha-tocopherol (p = 0.05) and alcohol consumption (p = < 0.01). Acetaminophen use (p = 0.05), coffee consumption (p = 0.05) and plasma lycopene (p = 0.06) were positively associated with CYP1A2 activity. After adjustment for these variables, no association was found between CYP1A2 activity and sex, race, age, education, smoking, physical activity, weight, vitamin E supplements, the other plasma micronutrients measured, and dietary intakes of red meat, processed meat and cruciferous vegetables. Results were similar for colorectal cancer cases and controls. Almost two-thirds (73%) of the variability in CYP1A2 activity remained unexplained. This study confirms an enhancing effect of acetaminophen and coffee on CYP1A2 activity and suggests and inhibitory effect of estrogens, alcohol and food sources of lutein and alpha-tocopherol on this enzyme.},

The relative sensitivity of drug and metabolite concentration-time profiles as indices of inhibition is assessed. Under steady-state conditions where inhibitor concentrations are maintained constant, the determination of metabolite in addition to drug kinetics provides little additional information when inhibition is nonselective in nature. However metabolite profiles do offer increased sensitivity when parallel routes of metabolism exist and there is selectivity of inhibitory action. Non-steady-state conditions are also investigated as they often apply in inhibition studies; the inhibitor is often administered as a single dose or as a multiple dosing regimen rather than by a constant rate intravenous infusion. Under the former conditions, when inhibitor concentrations in the body fluctuate during the study, metabolite kinetics can be more useful than drug kinetics. The changes evident in the metabolite concentration-time profiles are substantial due to both the inhibition per se and the nonlinearity in the system arising from inhibitor elimination. It is concluded that metabolite kinetics provide a useful aid in the detection of drug metabolism inhibition interactions.},

However, due to its narrow therapeutic range, moderate elevation of serum concentration can result in adverse drug reactions (ADRs). ADRs occur because of interhuman pharmacokinetic variability and interactions with coprescribed medicines. We developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of theophylline, caffeine, and ciprofloxacin metabolisms to: examine theophylline pharmacokinetic variability, and predict population-level outcomes of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). A simulation-based equation for personalized dosing of theophylline was derived. Simulations of DDI show that calculated personalized doses are safe even after cotreatment with large doses of strong inhibitors. Simulations of adult populations indicate that the elderly are most susceptible to ADRs stemming from theophylline-ciprofloxacin and theophylline-caffeine interactions. Females, especially Asians, due to their smaller average size, are more susceptible to DDI-induced ADRs following typical dosing practices. Our simulations also show that the higher adipose and lower muscle fractions in females significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of theophylline or ciprofloxacin.},

The ratios of 5-acetyl-amino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil (AFMU) to 1-methylxanthine (1X), AFMU to 1X plus 1-methyluric acid (1U), and AFMU to 1X + 1U + AFMU are indicative of N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity; the ratios of 1U to 1X and 1U to 1U + 1X indicate xanthine oxidase activity; and the ratio of the sum of 7-demethylated metabolites (AFMU + 1X + 1U) to the precursor for all three compounds, paraxanthine (PX), is a putative indicator of CYP1A2 oxidative activity. Our objective was to discern whether there are race-, gender-, and age-related differences in these indexes of drug-metabolizing activity. In 342 normal healthy unrelated subjects, metabolites were measured in urine collected after administration of low-dose caffeine. By two-way analysis of variance, NAT activity was higher in black subjects than in white subjects when assessed as AFMU/(1U + 1X) or as AFMU/(AFMU + 1U + 1X) (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively), but less so by use of AFMU/1X (p = 0.08). Xanthine oxidase activity, as assessed by 1U/1X or as 1U/(1U + 1X), was lower in black subjects than in white subjects (p = 0.02 and p = 0.001, respectively) and was lower in males than in females (p = 0.001 for both ratios). Females had higher AFMU/1X ratios (p = 0.03) because of higher xanthine oxidase activity. In a model in which AFMU/1X was the dependent variable and race, sex, age, and an index of xanthine oxidase (1U/1X) were independent variables, only race and 1U/1X were significant determinants of this NAT index (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively). The CYP1A2 ratio was lower in black subjects (p = 0.036) and in females (p = 0.015). Racial and gender differences in xanthine oxidase activity render the AFMU/1X ratio less reliable as an assessment of NAT activity in a heterogeneous population compared with the AFMU/(1U + 1X) or AFMU/(AFMU + 1U + 1X) ratios. The observed racial and gender differences in NAT, xanthine oxidase, and CYP1A2 activities may have implications for racial and gender differences in drug effects and carcinogen biotransformation.},

  abstract        = {Apparent pharmacokinetic parameters of caffeine elimination from the circulation were determined in 27 patients with histologically confirmed liver cirrhosis, 8 patients with miscellaneous liver disease, and 8 patients with other than liver disease. The usefullness of this quantitative test to assess the severity of liver cirrhosis was compared to the Child-Turcotte or Child-Pugh classification score as well as to the galactose elimination capacity of these patients. Using reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography caffeine, paraxanthine, theophylline, and theobromine were analysed in blood plasma collected before and after an oral dose of caffeine. Compared to apparent caffeine pharmacokinetics in patients with normal livers or miscellaneous liver disease, cirrhosis was characterized by a statistically significant reduction in apparent caffeine clearance and prolongation in half-life. The reduced apparent plasma disappearance rate of caffeine in cirrhotics was related to the retarded formation of paraxanthine which was the main metabolite of caffeine in blood plasma both in the absence or presence of liver disease. The apparent caffeine clearance in cirrhosis decreased with increasing Child-Turcotte classification score: Child's class A patients differed significantly from Child's class B or Child's class C patients, whereas the difference between Child's class B and C patients did not reach statistical significance (Wilcoxon's rank test). In addition there was a strong correlation between the Child-Pugh classification score and apparent caffeine clearance (P less than 0.001). However, no correlation existed between Child's classification and galactose elimination capacity. Our data emphasize the value of the Child-Turcotte or Child-Pugh classification in assessing the severity of liver cirrhosis in a simpler and less time-consuming way than using quantitative liver function tests.},

TMX and its metabolites were analyzed in plasma and urine by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The design permitted confirmation of most of the partial results in various experimental settings and contributed new data on the metabolic disposition of TMX, with specific reference to main dimethylxanthine metabolite found in plasma, paraxanthine (1,7-dimethylxanthine). Different analysis methods were compared for the calculated parameters (absorption and elimination rate constants and renal clearance)to assess the consistency of results. The kinetics of TMX and of its dimethylated metabolites in plasma were described with a model that used an analogdigital hybrid computing system. In addition to providing a comprehensive profile of TMS disposition in the healthy adult, the results indicate tha TMX exhibits dose-independent kinetics at the levels at which man normally takes TMX.},

Plasma samples were collected over the 24-h period following each dose and assayed for their caffeine content using a high-performance liquid chromatographic technique. The oral absorption was very rapid, reaching a peak (Tp) plasma concentration after 29.8 +/- 8.1 min (mean +/- SEM). In addition, the variation in the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was low, 10.0 +/- 1.0 micrograms/ml. The absolute bioavailability was assessed by comparing the areas under the plasma concentration vs. time curves for the intravenous and oral doses of caffeine. The rapid absorption resulted in essentially complete bioavailability of the oral caffeine, F(%) = 108.3 +/- 3.6%. The caffeine plasma half-lives varied from 2.7 to 9.9 h, indicating substantial inter-subject variability in its elimination.},

Subjects were analyzed individually, acting as their own controls, thus reducing interindividual variability. The present study showed that caffeine exhibited dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, particularly in subjects who showed high initial clearance with the low dose (70 mg) of caffeine. There was a significant decrease in caffeine clearance with increasing dose from 70 mg to 300 mg (n = 26, p less than 0.01, Dunnett's test), indicating saturable caffeine metabolism in the dose range tested. These findings imply that if caffeine is to be used as a guide to deteriorating liver function, serial caffeine clearance estimations should be performed in each individual subject, with use of the same dose of caffeine each time.},

Its enzymatic properties were compared with N-terminally modified CYP1A2. Although modified CYP1A2 is almost all high-spin, some wild-type CYP1A2 shifted to low-spin. Spectral binding titrations with several ligands could be performed with wild-type enzyme, but not with modified enzyme. Kinetic parameters for several substrates were similar for the two CYP1A2 enzymes. However, the oxidation rates of phenacetin by modified enzyme were approximately 2-fold higher than those by wild-type enzyme. The intermolecular isotope effects were approximately 2 for phenacetin O-deethylation catalyzed by both enzymes. However, the wild-type enzyme, but not the modified enzyme, increased C-hydroxylation when O-deethylation rates were lowered by deuterium substitution. Molecular switching indicates that phenacetin rotates within the active site of wild-type enzyme and suggests a looser conformation in the active site of the wild-type enzyme than of the modified enzyme. These results reveal that the overall enzymatic properties of wild-type CYP1A2 enzyme are quite similar to those of modified CYP1A2, although its active site environment seems to differ from that of the modified enzyme.},

Therefore, determining the abundance and activity of these enzymes is of value in the process of scaling in vitro data to in vivo metabolic parameters. Many of the studies involving the measurement of UGTs were conducted with too few samples, which did not provide a good indication of population values and the level of variability. Meta-analysis is used in the current study to combine all reported values (eight studies that used LC-MS isotope-labelled standard targeted quantitative methods), detect inconsistencies between the various datasets and describe correlations of expression between the quantified UGT enzymes. Some heterogeneity was observed between studies, especially in the UGT1A4, 2B7 and 2B10 datasets. However, in the absence of information on the inter-laboratory consistency of assays, it is difficult to assign these differences to the heterogeneity of the samples. Large inter-individual variability was observed in the collated data across this family of enzymes. Positive correlations between the expression levels of certain UGT enzymes were found in the collated data. These included the pairs: UGT1A4/2B4 (rs=0.71, p<0.0001, n=82), UGT2B4/2B15 (rs=0.63, p<0.0001, n=83), UGT2B7/2B15 (rs=0.81, p<0.0001, n=99). These correlations can be explained by common regulatory mechanisms involved in the expression of these proteins.},

  abstract        = {Cytochrome P450 (P450) and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes mediate a major proportion of phase I and phase II metabolism of xenobiotics. In vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) of hepatic clearance in conjunction with physiologically-based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) has become common practice in drug development. However, prediction of xenobiotic kinetics in virtual populations requires knowledge of both enzyme abundances and the extent to which these correlate. A multiplexed quantification concatemer (QconCAT) strategy was used in this study to quantify the expression of several P450 and UGT enzymes simultaneously and to establish correlations between various enzyme abundances in 24 individual liver samples (ages 27-66, 14 male). Abundances were comparable to previously reported values, including CYP2C9 (40.0 ± 26.0 pmol mg(-1)), CYP2D6 (11.9 ± 13.2 pmol mg(-1)), CYP3A4 (68.1 ± 52.3 pmol mg(-1)), UGT1A1 (33.6 ± 34.0 pmol mg(-1)), and UGT2B7 (82.9 ± 36.1 pmol mg(-1)), expressed as mean ± S.D. Previous reports of correlations in expression of various P450 (CYP3A4/CYP3A5*1/*3, CYP2C8/CYP2C9, and CYP3A4/CYP2B6) were confirmed. New correlations were demonstrated between UGTs [including UGT1A6/UGT1A9 (r(s) = 0.82, P < 0.0001) and UGT2B4/UGT2B15 (r(s) = 0.71, P < 0.0001)]. Expression of some P450 and UGT enzymes were shown to be correlated [including CYP1A2/UGT2B4 (r(s) = 0.67, P = 0.0002)]. The expression of CYP3A5 in individuals with *1/*3 genotype (n = 11) was higher than those with *3/*3 genotype (n = 10) (P < 0.0001). No significant effect of gender or history of smoking or alcohol use on enzyme expression was observed; however, expression of several enzymes declined with age. The correlation matrix produced for the first time by this study can be used to generate more realistic virtual populations with respect to abundance of various enzymes.},

Caffeine was administered intravenously on three different occasions over a 7-wk period: before vitamin C restriction, after approximately 4 wk of vitamin C restriction (15 mg dietary intake per day), and after 2 wk of vitamin C supplementation (500 mg orally, twice daily). Blood and urine samples were collected over a 48-h period after each caffeine administration. The plasma half-life, rate constant of elimination, apparent volume of distribution, total body clearance, renal clearance, and metabolic clearance of caffeine were determined. Simultaneous plasma, whole blood and leukocyte vitamin C concentrations were obtained. All of the average vitamin C concentrations monitored (plasma, whole blood, and leukocyte) changed significantly during the study, corresponding to the alterations in dietary vitamin C intake. Conversely, none of the caffeine pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated changed significantly during the study. The average metabolic clearance was approximately 77 (ml hr-1) kg-1 and the average half-life was approximately 4.6 h for all caffeine administrations. These results indicate that the elimination of caffeine in the elderly is not affected significantly by the concentrations of vitamin C achieved during this study.},

  abstract        = {Caffeine was analyzed in human plasma and saliva by a simple, rapid, and sensitive radioimmunoassay procedure. Immunization of rabbits with an antigen prepared by coupling 7-(5-carboxypentyl)-1,3-dimethylxanthine to bovine serum albumin resulted in the formation of antibodies selective for caffeine as opposed to various mono- and dimethylxanthines, mono-, di-, and trimethyluric acids and a variety of common drugs. The radioligand used for competitive binding studies was 7-(2,3-3H2-propyl)-1,3-dimethylxanthine. The procedure permits direct analysis of caffeine in plasma or saliva without extraction. Comparison with a high pressure liquid chromatography method for the analysis of caffeine gave satisfactory results and showed no evidence for interference by metabolites. A caffeine half-life of 4.0 hours determined by the radioimmunoassay was in agreement with previous work. Comparison of human plasma and saliva levels by the radioimmunoassay procedure indicated approximately equal concentrations in the two fluids.},

The study design was an open-label, randomized two-phase crossover study. Eleven healthy subjects were randomly assigned either to receive 500 mL of coffee enema for 10 minutes or to consume 180 mL of ready-to-drink coffee beverage. After a washout period of at least 10 days, all the subjects were switched to receive the alternate coffee procedure. Blood samples were collected immediately before and at specific time points until 12 hours after coffee administration in each phase. The mean caffeine content in both the coffee solution prepared for the coffee enema and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage was not statistically different. The C max and AUC of caffeine obtained from the coffee enema were about 3.5 times significantly less than those of the coffee consumed orally, despite having slightly but statistically faster T max. The t 1/2 of caffeine obtained following both coffee procedures did not statistically differ. In summary, the relative bioavailability of caffeine obtained from the coffee enema was about 3.5 times significantly less than those of the coffee consumed orally.},

Identification is made by absorbance detection at 273 nm. Under optimized conditions, the detection limit of the HPLC method is 0.1 pg/mL for all three methylxanthines. This method is applied to urine and to 25 different beverage samples, which included coffee, tea, chocolate, and coconut water. The concentration ranges determined in the beverages and urine are: < 0.1 pg/mL to 350 microg/mL and 3.21 microg/mL to 71.2 microg/mL for caffeine; < 0.1 pg/mL to 32 microg mL and < 0.1 pg/mL to 13.2 microg/mL for theobromine; < 0.1 pg/mL to 47 microg/mL and < 0.1 pg/mL to 66.3 microg/mL for theophylline.

In order to obtain insight into the pharmacology of caffeine after inhalation in heroin users, the pharmacokinetics of caffeine and its dimethylxanthine metabolites were studied. The objectives were to establish the population pharmacokinetics under these exceptional circumstances and to compare the results to published data regarding intravenous and oral administration in healthy volunteers. Diacetylmorphine preparations containing 100 mg of caffeine were used by 10 persons by inhalation. Plasma concentrations of caffeine, theobromine, paraxanthine and theophylline were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Non-linear mixed effects modelling was used to estimate population pharmacokinetic parameters. The model was evaluated by the jack-knife procedure. Caffeine was rapidly and effectively absorbed after inhalation. Population pharmacokinetics of caffeine and its dimethylxanthine metabolites could adequately and simultaneously be described by a linear multi-compartment model. The volume of distribution for the central compartment was estimated to be 45.7 l and the apparent elimination rate constant of caffeine at 8 hr after inhalation was 0.150 hr(-1) for a typical individual. The bioavailability was approximately 60%. The presented model adequately describes the population pharmacokinetics of caffeine and its dimethylxanthine metabolites after inhalation of the caffeine sublimate of a 100 mg tablet. Validation proved the stability of the model. Pharmacokinetics of caffeine after inhalation and intravenous administration are to a large extent similar. The bioavailability of inhaled caffeine is approximately 60% in experienced smokers.},

CYP1A2 activity was determined by plasma paraxanthine:caffeine ratio (17X:137X) 4 h after the intake of a standardized cup of coffee in 146 Turkish healthy volunteers. Seven CYP1A2 polymorphisms (-3860G>A, -3113G>A, -2467del/T, -739T>G, -729C>T, -163C>A and 5347T>C) were analyzed. The 17X:137X ratios were increased in smokers (p < 0.0001) and tended to be higher in men both among nonsmokers (p = 0.051) and smokers (p = 0.064). Age-related differences were observed only among nonsmoking women (p = 0.024). The -163C>A polymorphism correlated with 17X:137X ratios only in smokers (p = 0.006). Furthermore, increased 17X:137X ratios were observed in CYP1A2 haplotype H4 (-3860G, -3113G, -2467del, -739T, -729C, -163A and 5347T) carriers in the overall study population (p = 0.026). Multiple regression analyses including smoking, gender, -163C>A genotype and age revealed a significant influence of smoking (p < 0.0001) and gender (p = 0.002) in the overall study population. However, in nonsmokers only the influence of gender remained significant (p = 0.021), while in smokers the influence of the -163C>A genotype held the statistical significance (p = 0.019). The influence of haplotype H4 remained significant (p = 0.028) in the overall study population in similar analyses. Smoking has the strongest impact on CYP1A2 activity, while gender and haplotype H4 showed marginal effects. The influence of the -163C>A polymorphism on CYP1A2 activity in smokers suggests an effect on the inducibility of the enzyme.},

  abstract     = {Cytochrome P450 enzymes are a family of heme-containing proteins located throughout the body with roles in metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds. Among exogenous compounds, clinically relevant pharmaceutical agents are nearly all metabolized by P450 enzymes. However, the activity of the different cytochrome P450 enzymes varies among individuals and, therefore, so does drug efficacy as well as susceptibility to side effects and toxicity. Thus, assessing P450 activity is of great interest in drug development and clinical pharmacology. This study investigates the phenotyping of a single P450 activity by analyzing urine samples using isocratic reverse-phase HPLC. Specifically, the activity of human P450 1A2, which converts caffeine into paraxanthine, can be investigated by measuring the change in caffeine and paraxanthine concentrations in urine over time following a single dose of caffeine. There is an observable relationship between caffeine intake and paraxanthine formation that varies among individuals. This laboratory exercise provides a means for simple assessment of P450 1A2 metabolic activity using an HPLC method without additional extraction or purification steps and introduces students to the complexities of individualized medicine as well as the basic biochemical techniques of sample preparation and quantitative HPLC. Furthermore, students may design and test their own hypothesis using these methods.},

Inhibition experiments were carried out with the quinolones norfloxacin and pefloxacin and the substrate, caffeine. Additionally, in vivo pharmacokinetics of paraxanthine was determined in CYP1A2-null and wild-type mice. All LM produced the primary metabolites of caffeine and paraxanthine. In human LM, the main metabolite of caffeine was paraxanthine (K(M) 0.4 and 0.5 mmol L(-1)). In wild-type and CYP1A2-null mice LM, the main caffeine metabolite was 1,3,7-trimethylurate, but formation was not saturable. Apparent K(M) for paraxanthine formation from caffeine in wild-type and CYP1A2-null murine LM were 0.2 and 4.9 mmol L(-1), respectively. The main metabolite of paraxanthine was 1-methylxanthine in human (K(M) 0.13 and 0.2 mmol L(-1)) and in wild-type mice LM (K(M) 0.53 mmol L(-1)). In CYP1A2-null murine LM, the main paraxanthine metabolite was 7-methylxanthine. The quinolones competitively inhibited caffeine metabolism in human but not in wild-type or CYP1A2-null murine LM. No obvious differences were seen for blood pharmacokinetics and urinary metabolite excretion of paraxanthine between CYP1A2-null and wild-type mice. Thus, for paraxanthine, norfloxacin and pefloxacin interaction with CYP1A2 there were clear differences between mice and man. Our results suggest that an interspecies comparison is required for the metabolism of individual xenobiotics interacting with CYP1A2 prior to the use of mice models to predict its toxicity and/or pharmacological activity in man.},

To determine the relationship between the appearance of paraxanthine (caffeine's major dimethylxanthine metabolite) and free fatty acid (FFA) mobilization after intravenous caffeine administration, 10 men were studied at rest after receiving a dose of 4 mg/kg lean body mass. Venous blood samples were obtained before dosing and at minutes 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180. Serum levels of FFA, glycerol, caffeine, and paraxanthine were determined in duplicate. Concentrations of FFA and glycerol were corrected for plasma volume changes. A high negative correlation was seen between decreases in caffeine and increases in FFA (r = -0.90) and a high positive correlation was seen between the appearance of paraxanthine and FFA (r = 0.93). It was concluded that paraxanthine may play a role in increased lipolysis after caffeine administration in humans.},

Groups of adult male rats were given different doses of paraxanthine as iv bolus injections. Blood cell/plasma partition and the binding of the compound to rat plasma proteins (determined by equilibrium dialysis) were investigated. The fraction bound (15%) remained constant in the concentration range of 1-100 micrograms/ml. Partition was also constant over a wide range of doses. Up to the 10 mg/kg dose, the paraxanthine followed first order kinetics and blood concentrations vs. time data were described by a one-compartment, open model system. The mean half-life and elimination rate constant were 1 hr and 0.70 hr-1, respectively. The average apparent volume of distribution was 1.50 liters/kg and total clearance was 0.90 liter/hr/kg. After larger doses (15 and 30 mg/kg), kinetics were nonlinear. The area under the blood concentration-time curve increased, but not in proportion to the dose, and modifications of pharmacokinetic parameters were shown. These findings indicate that in the rat paraxanthine is eliminated by a saturable process with an apparent Km of about 31 micrograms/ml and an apparent Vmax of about 0.40 micrograms/ml/min. Close estimates were obtained by two different methods of calculation. Our results suggest that the pharmacokinetic profile of paraxanthine could be important to understand the kinetics and the potential toxic effects of its parent compound, caffeine, in animals and man.},

  abstract        = {The efficiency of drug metabolism by a single enzyme can be measured as the fractional metabolic clearance which can be used as a measure of whole body activity for that enzyme. Measurement of activity of multiple enzymes simultaneously is feasible using a cocktail approach, however, analytical approach using different assays for drug probes can be cumbersome. A quantitative ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) based method for the rapid measurement of six cytochrome P450 (CYP) probe drugs and their relevant metabolites is described. The six specific probe substrates/metabolites are caffeine/paraxanthine (CYP1A2), flurbiprofen/4'-hydroxyflurbiprofen (CYP2C9), mephenytoin/4'-hydroxymephenytoin (CYP2C19), debrisoquine/4-hydroxydebrisoquine (CYP2D6), chlorzoxazone/6'-hydroxychlorzoxazone (CYP2E1) and dapsone/N-monoacetyldapsone (NAT2). These probes were quantified by stable isotope dilution from plasma and urine. The present workflow provides a robust, fast and sensitive assay for the "Pittsburgh cocktail", and has been successfully applied to a clinical phenotyping study of liver disease. A representative group of 17 controls and patients with chronic liver disease were administered orally caffeine (100 mg), chlorzoxazone (250 mg), debrisoquine (10 mg), mephenytoin (100 mg), flurbiprofen (50 mg) and dapsone (100 mg). Urine (0 through 8 h) and plasma (4 and 8 h) samples were analyzed for drug/metabolite amounts by stable isotope dilution UPLC-MS/MS. The phenotypic activity of drug metabolizing enzymes was investigated with 17 patient samples. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) was optimized for each drug and metabolite. In the method developed, analytes were resolved by reversed-phase by development of a gradient using a water/methanol solvent system. SRM of each analyte was performed in duplicate on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer utilizing an 8 min analytical method each, one with the source operating in the positive mode and one in the negative mode, using the same solvent system. This method enabled quantification of each drug (caffeine, chlorzoxazone, debrisoquine, mephenytoin, flurbiprofen, and dapsone) and its resulting primary metabolite in urine or plasma in patient samples. The method developed and the data herein demonstrate a robust quantitative assay to examine changes in CYP enzymes both independently or as part of a cocktail. The clinical use of a combination of probe drugs with UPLC-MS/MS is a highly efficient tool for the assessment of CYP enzyme activity in liver disease.},

Similarly, the ratios of [omeprazole]/[5-hydroxyomeprazole] (CYP2C19) and [paraxanthine]/[caffeine] (CYP1A2) in 4 h plasma samples and the log ratio of [dextromethorphan]/[dextrorphan] (CYP2D6) in 8 h urine samples and the 4 h plasma concentrations of midazolam (CYP3A) after single administration or well-established three-drug cocktail of caffeine, omeprazole, and dextromethorphan were not significantly different from those after the new five-drug cocktail.

There was a clear negative association between age and total P450 content, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity and levels of 2E1 and 3A proteins. 1A2 and 2C proteins were unaltered with advancing age. Gender did not influence the expression of any of the CYP proteins. Cigarette smoking was associated with enhanced levels of 1A2, but effects of drug ingestion and alcohol consumption were not apparent in this study, probably because of case selection.

The pharmacokinetic variables included maximal plasma/serum concentration (Cmax), time to maximal plasma/serum concentration (Tmax), elimination half-life (T1/2), area-under-the-curve plasma/serum concentrations (AUC), clearance (Cl), volume of distribution (VD), and bioavailability. The literature search identified 392 records. Twenty-two studies were included in the review. Melatonin dosages varied between 0.3 and 100 mg and were administered either orally or intravenously. Cmax ranged from 72.1 (10 ml/h; 0.02 mg, IV) to 101,163 pg/ml (100 mg, oral). Tmax ranged between 15 (2 mg) and 210 min (10 mg). T1/2 ranged from 28 (0.005 mg, IV) to 126 min (4 mg, oral), whereas AUC ranged between 5400 (0.005 mg, IV) and 6.56 × 10(10) pg/ml × min (1 mg, oral). Cl ranged from 0.97 (0.005 mg, IV) to 132.50 L/min (6 mg, oral), whereas VD ranged between 35 (0.005 mg, IV) and 1602 L (4 mg, oral). Bioavailability of oral melatonin ranged from 9 to 33%. Pharmacokinetics was affected by age, caffeine, smoking, oral contraceptives, feeding status, and fluvoxamine. Critically ill patients displayed accelerated absorption and compromised elimination. Despite methodological differences between the included studies, Tmax was approximately 50 min following oral immediate-release formulations of melatonin. T1/2 was 45 min in both administration routes. Cmax, AUC, Cl, and VD varied extensively between studies. Bioavailability of oral melatonin was approximately 15%.},

Twelve healthy subjects, six smokers and six nonsmokers, were given melatonin (6 mg) either alone or in combination with caffeine (3 x 200 mg). Blood samples for the analysis of melatonin or caffeine and paraxanthine were taken from 1 h before until 6 h after intake of melatonin. Subjects were genotyped with respect to the CYP1A2*1F (C734A) polymorphism. When caffeine was coadministered the Cmax and AUC of melatonin were increased on average by 142% (P = 0.001, confidence interval on the difference 44, 80%) and 120% (P < 0.001, confidence interval on the difference 63, 178%), respectively. The inhibitory effect of caffeine was more pronounced in nonsmokers and in individuals with the *1F/*1F genotype. The results of this study revealed a pronounced effect of caffeine on the bioavailability of orally given melatonin, most probably due to inhibition of CYP1A2 activity.},

  abstract        = {A cocktail approach can detect the activities of multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms following the administration of multiple CYP-specific substrates in a single experiment. This study aimed to develop a simultaneous and comprehensive in vivo analysis of CYP activity in rats. The rats received an oral administration of losartan (10 mg/kg) and omeprazole (40 mg/kg). Caffeine (1 mg/kg), dextromethorphan (10 mg/kg) and midazolam (10 mg/kg) were administered 15 min later. In the drug-interaction phase, the rats were treated orally with dexamethasone (80 mg/kg) 24 h before, or with ketoconazole (10 mg/kg), fluvoxamine (100 mg kg) or fluconazole (10 mg/kg) 1 h before the administration of cocktail drugs. The concentrations of the drugs and their metabolites were determined by LC/MS/MS. Plasma concentrations of five CYP substrates and their metabolites were simultaneously evaluated after the oral drug administration. Fluvoxamine and fluconazole significantly increased the Cmax and AUC of caffeine, and the AUC of omeprazole and midazolam. Dexamethasone significantly increased Cmax and AUC of losartan, while it decreased the Cmax of midazolam. Ketoconazole showed no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the tested drugs. In conclusion, a cocktail approach was developed for simultaneous and comprehensive analysis of the activities of multiple CYP isoforms in rats. In this approach, the effects of inhibitors and an inducer of various CYP isoforms were examined. Although further studies are necessary to predict the effects in humans, this approach may be expected to serve as a convenient method for detecting drug-drug interactions in rats.},

Thus, the apparent inhibitor constant of fluvoxamine, Ki, ranged from 0.12 to 0.24 microM. Seven other SSRIs, citalopram, N-desmethylcitalopram, fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline and litoxetin either did not inhibit or were weak inhibitors of the O-deethylation of phenacetin.

They differ, however, in their pharmacokinetic properties. Under steady-state concentrations, their half-lives range between 1 and 4 days for fluoxetine (7 and 15 days for norfluoxetine) and between 21 (paroxetine) and 36 (citalopram) hr for the other SSRIs. Sertraline and citalopram show linear and fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine nonlinear pharmacokinetics. SSRIs underlie an extensive metabolism with high interindividual variability, whereby cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes play a major role. Therefore, resulting blood concentrations are highly variable between individuals. Except for N-demethylated fluoxetine, metabolites of SSRIs do not contribute to clinical actions. Therapeutically effective blood concentrations are unclear so far, although there is evidence for minimal effective and upper-threshold concentrations that should not be exceeded. Paroxetine and, to a lesser degree, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 and fluvoxamine of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. This can give rise to drug-drug interactions that may have no effect, lead to intoxication, or improve the therapeutic response. These different pharmacokinetic properties of the five SSRIs, especially their drug-drug interaction potential, should be considered when selecting a distinct SSRI for treatment of depression or other disorders with a suggested dysfunction of the serotonergic system in the brain.},

None of the drugs showed potent inhibition of CYP2A6 (coumarin 7-hydroxylase) or CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylase), while norfluoxetine was the only potent inhibitor of CYP3A having IC50 values of 11 microM and 19 microM for testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylase and cortisol 6 beta-hydroxylase, respectively. 3. Norfluoxetine, sertraline and fluvoxamine inhibited CYP1A1 (7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase) in microsomes from human placenta (IC50 values 29 microM, 35 microM and 80 microM, respectively). Fluvoxamine was a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2-mediated 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity (IC50 = 0.3 microM) in human liver. 4. In microsomes from three human livers fluvoxamine potently inhibited all pathways of theophylline biotransformation, the apparent inhibitor constant, Ki, was 0.07-0.13 microM, 0.05-0.10 microM and 0.16-0.29 microM for inhibition of 1-methylxanthine, 3-methylxanthine and 1,3-dimethyluric acid formation, respectively. Seven other SSRIs showed either weak or no inhibition of theophylline metabolism. 5. Ethanol inhibited the formation of 1,3-dimethyluric acid with K(i) value of 300 microM, a value which is consistent with inhibition of CYP2E1. Ethanol and fluvoxamine both inhibited 8-hydroxylation by about 45% and, in combination, the compounds decreased the formation of 1,3-dimethyluric acid by 90%, indicating that CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 are equally important isoforms for the 8-hydroxylation of theophylline. 6. It is concluded that pharmacokinetic interaction between fluvoxamine and theophylline is due to potent inhibition of CYP1A2.},

Caffeine significantly decreased the plasma concentrations at 6 time points (P<0.05) and total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (156.5+/-51.7 vs. 118.9+/-38.2 ng/h/mL, P<0.01) of FLV.

The main purpose of the present study was to evaluate this interaction in vitro in human liver microsomes. A high-performance liquid chromatography method was developed in order to assay 1,3-dimethylxanthine, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, 3,7-dimethylxanthine and 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid formed from caffeine by human liver microsomes. The limit of detection was 0.06 nmol.mg protein-1.hr-1. As expected, fluvoxamine was a very potent inhibitor of the formation of the N-demethylated caffeine metabolites, displaying Ki values of 0.08-0.28 microM. The formation of 1,7-dimethylxanthine was virtually abolished by 10 microM of fluvoxamine, indicating that the N3-demethylation of caffeine is almost exclusively catalysed by CYP1A2. The CYP3A4 inhibitors, ketoconazole and bromocriptine, inhibited 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid formation with Kis of 0.75 microM and 5 microM, respectively, thus further supporting the involvement of CYP3A4 in the 8-hydroxylation of caffeine. The study shows that fluvoxamine, as expected, is a potent inhibitor of the metabolism of caffeine in vitro.},

Oral caffeine (2 mg/kg), oral dextromethorphan (30 mg), and intravenous midazolam (0.025 mg/kg) were administered to 10 white male volunteers every 14 days for 4 months and to 10 white premenopausal female volunteers during the midfollicular and midluteal phases of the menstrual cycle for 4 complete cycles (8 total phenotyping measures). The first 6 phenotyping measures were used to establish baseline activity. Subjects were given 150 mg/day fluvoxamine for the fourth month or cycle of the study. Enzyme activity for CYP1A2, CYP2D6, NAT2, and XO was expressed as urinary metabolite ratios. Midazolam plasma clearance was used to express CYP3A activity. No difference between baseline and weeks 2 and 4 of fluvoxamine therapy was observed for NAT2 or XO metabolite ratios. For CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A phenotypes, significant differences existed between baseline and fluvoxamine therapy. For CYP1A2, the mean urinary metabolite ratio (+/-SD) was 7.53 +/- 7.44 at baseline and 4.30 +/- 2.82 with fluvoxamine ( P = .012). Mean CYP2D6 molar urinary dextromethorphan ratios before and after fluvoxamine therapy were 0.00780 +/- 0.00694 and 0.0153 +/- 0.0127, respectively (P = .011). Midazolam clearance decreased from 0.0081 +/ 0.0024 L/min/kg at baseline to 0.0054 +/- 0.0021 L/min/kg with therapy (P = .0091). For CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A, fluvoxamine therapy changed the phenotyping measures by a median of -44.4%, 123.5%, and -34.4%, respectively. We concluded that fluvoxamine may cause significant inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A activity. This metabolic inhibition may have serious implications for a variety medications.},

Bioequivalence testing showed nonequivalence in drug versus no-drug treatment on the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes (as reflected by metabolite ratios following probe drug administration); the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and NAT-2 decreased following the oral contraceptive, whereas the activity of CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 increased. No effects on xanthine oxidase or hepatic CYP3A were seen. Application of a non-parametric statistical testing approach revealed a significant difference only for CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.

  abstract        = {Oral contraceptives (OCs) can inhibit drug metabolism, but their effect on various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and drugs can be different. Our objective was to study the effect of combined OCs, containing ethinyl estradiol (INN, ethinylestradiol) and gestodene, on CYP1A2 activity, as well as their interaction potential with tizanidine. In a parallel-group study, 15 healthy women using OCs and 15 healthy women without OCs (control subjects) ingested a single dose of 4 mg tizanidine. Plasma and urine concentrations of tizanidine, as well as several of its metabolites (M-3, M-4, M-5, M-9, and M-10), and pharmacodynamic variables were measured until 24 hours after dosing. As a marker of CYP1A2 activity, an oral caffeine test was performed in both groups. The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity [AUC0-infinity] of tizanidine was 3.9 times greater (P<.001) and the mean peak plasma tizanidine concentration (Cmax) was 3.0 times higher (P<.001) in the OC users than in the control subjects. In 1 OC user the AUC0-infinity of tizanidine exceeded the mean AUC0-infinity of the control subjects by nearly 20 times. There were no significant differences in the elimination half-life or time to peak concentration in plasma of tizanidine between the groups. Tizanidine/metabolite ratios in plasma (M-3 and M-4) and urine (M-3, M-4, M-5, M-9, and M-10) were 2 to 10 times higher in the users of OCs than in the control subjects. In the OC group the excretion of unchanged tizanidine into urine was, on average, 3.8 times greater (P=.008) than in the control subjects. The plasma caffeine/paraxanthine ratio was 2.8 times higher (P<.001) in the OC users than in the control subjects. The caffeine/paraxanthine ratio correlated significantly with the AUC0-infinity and peak concentration of tizanidine in plasma, with its excretion into urine, and with, for example, the tizanidine/M-3 and tizanidine/M-4 area under the plasma concentration-time curve ratios. Both the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lowered by tizanidine more in the OC users (-29+/- 10 mm Hg and -21+/- 8 mm Hg, respectively) than in the control subjects (-17+/- 9 mm Hg and -13+/- 5 mm Hg, respectively) (P < .01). OCs containing ethinyl estradiol and gestodene increase, to a clinically significant extent, the plasma concentrations and effects of tizanidine, probably mainly by inhibiting its CYP1A2-mediated presystemic metabolism. Care should be exercised when tizanidine is prescribed to OC users.},

Each subject received 162 mg caffeine base orally after an overnight fast. OCS subjects had a prolonged elimination half-life of caffeine, (mean 7.88 h vs 5.37 h in the controls). This was the result of marked impairment of the plasma clearance of caffeine (1.05 vs 1.75 ml/min/kg, respectively) with no change in apparent volume of distribution (0.685 in OCS vs 0.7501/kg in the control group). The absorption parameters determined were peak plasma caffeine concentration (3.99 vs 4.09 micrograms/ml) and time to peak concentration after drug administration (1.52 vs 0.79), which was moderately prolonged in OCS users. Thus, caffeine clearance, previously reported to be a specific marker of cytochrome P-448 activity in man, is decreased by chronic OCS use. This suggests that OCS may cause significant impairment of this enzyme activity as assessed in vivo. With chronic caffeine consumption, OCS users are predicted to have an increased steady-state plasma caffeine concentration as compared to non-OCS users.},

Other pharmacokinetic parameters of caffeine, such as tmax and Cmax, were not affected. Clearance values returned to pretreatment values 1 month after the last administration of the oral contraceptives. There was no difference in the reduction of caffeine clearance between contraceptive formulations. A small, but significant difference in the AUC(0-24 h) values of ethinylestradiol was noted between both preparations. There was no correlation between the AUC(model) values of caffeine and the AUC(0-24 h) values of ethinylestradiol.

The present study aims to determine whether gender and cigarette smoking influence the results of [13C]ABT as well as to confirm the effect of oral contraceptive steroids (OCS) intake on this metabolic test. Hundred and ten healthy subjects, including men and women, smoker and non-smoker, women taking OCS or not, were phenotyped for CYP1A2 using the [13C]caffeine breath test and underwent a [13C]ABT. Both tests showed large inter-individual variations in accordance with that of CYP450 liver content. [13C]ABT was sensitive enough to point out a significant induction or inhibition related to cigarette smoking habits or OCS. The combined effect of smoking and OCS resulted in an overall unchanged metabolic activity. Consequently, the impact of the studied conditions on the [13C]ABT parameters must be considered by clinicians or clinical investigators.},

  abstract        = {The impact of gender, use of oral contraceptive steroids (OCS), coffee consumption and of smoking on the metabolism of sparteine, caffeine, and paracetamol was studied in 194 randomly selected subjects (98 male and 95 female). Thirty-eight of the male volunteers were cigarette smokers, 40 of the female subjects were smokers and/or users of OCS. The metabolic ratio of sparteine oxidation (MRs) showed a trimodal distribution. 7.7% of the subjects had a MRs > 20 and thus were poor metabolizers (PMs). Within the extensive metabolizer (EM) subjects, a distinct subgroup accounting for 11% was observed with 20 > MRs > 1.2. Six of the 15 phenotypical PMs were heterozygous EMs by genotyping. This indicates the existence of one or several CYP2D6 mutations which cannot be identified by the currently employed genotyping methods. In each subgroup, i.e. smokers/OCS and non-smokers/non-OCS, the cumulative frequency distribution of the heterozygous (wt/B) phenotype caused a shift to higher MRs compared with the wild-type homozygotes (wt/wt). Thus, for the in vivo activity of CYP2D6, genetic determinants prevail over environmental factors. Smoking, use of oral contraceptive steroids, caffeine consumption, or gender had no influence on sparteine metabolism. The distribution of the paracetamol glucuronide/paracetamol metabolic ratio appeared to be unimodal although skewed. Glucuronidation capacity was clearly affected by gender, OCS use and smoking. It was higher in male than in female subjects. Male smokers had the highest, and female non-smokers/non-OCS users the lowest metabolic ratio. CYP1A2 activity, as determined by a caffeine metabolic ratio ((AFMU + 1X + 1U)/1, 7U), was multimodally distributed and was clearly increased in smokers. It was significantly correlated to paracetamol glucoronidation in male heavy smokers (r=0.85), suggesting an element of co-regulation of CYP1A2 and of paracetamol conjugating UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isozymes, including UGTI.6.},

We recently observed that a group of type-2 diabetes patients consumed more caffeine (coffee) on a daily basis than non-type-2 diabetes controls. Here, we investigated whether type-2 diabetes cases may metabolize caffeine faster than non-type-2 diabetes controls. To estimate CYP1A2 enzyme activity, an established marker of caffeine metabolism, we quantified the paraxanthine/caffeine concentration ratio in saliva in 57 type-2 diabetes and 146 non-type-2 diabetes participants in a case-control field study. All participants completed validated questionnaires regarding demographic status, health and habitual caffeine intake, and were genotyped for the functional -163C > A polymorphism of the CYP1A2 gene. In the diabetes group, we found a larger proportion of participants with the highly inducible CYP1A2 genotype. Furthermore, the paraxanthine/caffeine ratio, time-corrected to mitigate the impact of different saliva sampling times with respect to the last caffeine intake, was higher than in the control group. Participants who reported habitually consuming more caffeine than the population average showed higher CYP1A2 activity than participants with lower than average caffeine consumption. Multiple regression analyses revealed that higher caffeine intake was potentially an important mediator of higher CYP1A2 activity. Estimated CYP1A2 enzyme activity, and thus speed of caffeine metabolism, was higher in our type-2 diabetes group; this was possibly due to higher intake of caffeine, a known inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme activity. Given the fairly small sample sizes, the results need to be considered as preliminary and require validation in larger populations.},

Moreover, the influence of perazine on other caffeine metabolic pathways such as 7-N-demethylation (CYP1A2, CYP2C8/9, CYP3A4) and 8-hydroxylation (CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C8/9) was also determined. The Dixon analysis showed that in both human liver microsomes and Supersomes CYP1A2 perazine potently and to a similar degree inhibited caffeine 3-N-demethylation (K(i) = 3.5 microM) and 1-N-demethylation (K(i) = 5 microM). Perazine moderately diminished the rate of caffeine 7-N-demethylation in Supersomes CYP1A2 (K(i) = 11.5 microM) and liver microsomes (K(i) = 20 microM), and attenuated C-8-hydroxylation (K(i) = 15.5 microM) in Supersomes CYP1A2. On the other hand, perazine weakly inhibited caffeine C-8-hydroxylation in liver microsomes (K(i) = 98 microM). About 80% of basal CYP1A2 activity was reduced by the therapeutic concentrations of perazine (5-10 microM). The obtained results show that perazine at its therapeutic concentrations is a potent inhibitor of human CYP1A2. Hence, taking account of CYP1A2 contribution to the metabolism of endogenous substances (steroids), drugs (xanthine derivatives, phenacetin, propranolol, imipramine, phenothiazine neuroleptics, clozapine) and carcinogenic compounds, the inhibition of CYP1A2 by perazine may be of physiological, pharmacological and toxicological importance.},

  abstract        = {This study was designed to better understand genetic variation in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene CYP1A2 and its impact on CYP1A2 activity in Chinese subjects. CYP1A2 genetic polymorphisms were screened by direct sequencing in 27 selected Chinese subjects. Plasma 1,7-dimethylxanthine/caffeine ratios 5 hours after a 100-mg caffeine administration, used as an index of CYP1A2 in vivo activity, were determined in 422 healthy subjects. Five single-nucleotide polymorphism markers, including G-860A (CYP1A2*1C), T-3594G, G-3113A, A-163C (CYP1A2*1F), and C5347T (CYP1A2*1B), were selected and genotyped by either polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism or direct sequencing. Thirteen polymorphisms and 2 linkage disequilibrium blocks with a boundary around -2467 were identified at this locus. The allele frequency for -3860A, -3594G, -3113A, -163C, and 5347T was 0.21, 0.15, 0.10, 0.36, and 0.14, respectively, in the CYP1A2-phenotyped cohort. A significant difference in CYP1A2 activity was observed among genotypes of polymorphism G-3113A (P = .038), and CYP1A2 activity in subjects carrying the AA genotype was lower than that in those carrying the GA (P = .096) and GG genotypes (P = .036): -0.45 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- SD), -0.32 +/- 0.16, and -0.29 +/- 0.16, respectively. Further analysis based on haplotype pairs found a 1.92-fold variation (95% confidence interval, 1.13-2.71) in mean CYP1A2 activity between haplotype pairs 13 and 15, and the difference was significant (-0.19 +/- 0.15 versus -0.45 +/- 0.05, P = .016). As compared with haplotype pair 10, haplotype pairs 9 and 15 and most haplotype pairs heterozygous for the haplotype with an A allele at -3113, including pairs 5, 8, and 12, also showed significantly lower CYP1A2 activity (P = .015, .048, .008, .024, and .014 for pairs 5, 8, 9, 12, and 15, respectively). In addition, haplotype pairs 5, 9, and 12 also showed significantly lower CYP1A2 activity than pair 13 (P = .034, .020, and .037 for pairs 5, 9, and 12, respectively). The G-3113A polymorphism is associated with decreased CYP1A2 activity, haplotype pairs 10 and 13 are responsible for high CYP1A2 activity, and haplotype pairs 5, 8, 9, 12, and 15 are responsible for low CYP1A2 activity in Chinese subjects.},

  abstract        = {Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) has previously been shown to undergo metabolic switching in vivo when the N-1 or the N-7 methyl groups were trideuteromethylated [Horning et al. (1976) Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Stable Isotopes, pp 41-54]. We have examined the effect of replacing the N-3 methyl group with a trideuteromethyl group. The corresponding isotope effects can then be used to distinguish the kinetic mechanism by which four primary metabolites can be formed from one substrate by one cytochrome P450 (P450). We have synthesized 3-CD3-caffeine and 3-CD3-7-CD3-caffeine as well as trideuteromethylated analogs of each of the in vitro metabolites formed by cytochrome P4501A2. The observed competitive isotope effects for the metabolites, which do not result from deuterium abstraction (theobromine, theophylline), demonstrate that the nondissociative mechanism applies to caffeine metabolism by cytochrome P4501A2. Thus, there must be equilibration of the kinetically distinguishable activated P450-substrate complexes at rates competitive with hydrogen abstraction. The true isotope effects for the N-3 demethylation of caffeine were derived from the ratios of the amount of paraxanthine relative to the amount of theobromine or theophylline. The resultant ratios indicate that these isotope effects are essentially intrinsic. Observation of the isotope effects on N-3 demethylation was facilitated by branching to the minor in vitro metabolites as well as water formation. Product release is not rate-limiting for this system.},

Caffeine metabolic ratios were determined after an oral bolus of labelled caffeine in 20 healthy subjects with different characteristic CYP1A2 activity, relative to smoking habit and oral contraceptive intake. The use of labelled caffeine for the calculation of metabolic ratios avoided taking into account the important background of endogenous caffeine metabolites, very difficult to eliminate even after a specific diet. The selectivity and high sensitivity of mass spectrometry detection allowed urine collections for only a 3h period. Comparison between characteristic groups showed that labelled caffeine metabolic ratios were sensitive markers of changes in CYP1A2 activity.},

  abstract        = {(i) To compare the phenotyping of healthy subjects for NAT2 and CYP1A2 activities with caffeine, by the simultaneous assay of the urinary metabolites AFMU and AAMU, and (ii) to ascertain whether NAT2 and CYP1A2 phenotyping is influenced by the use of AFMU or AAMU in the metabolite ratio. Thirty-five healthy subjects (16 men, 19 women) participated to the study. Caffeine metabolite concentrations were measured in urine collected 8 h after 2.5 mg kg-1 caffeine intake using a new validated h.p.l.c. method. The metabolite ratios AFMU/1X, AFMU/(AFMU+1X+1U), AAMU/1X, AAMU/(AAMU+1X+1 U), and (AFMU+1U+1X)/17U, (AAMU+1U+1X)/17U were determined as indices of NAT2 and CYP1A2 activity, respectively. Slow and rapid acetylators were similarly identified using the four NAT2 metabolite ratios in 139 out of 140 measurements. An appreciable amount of AAMU was present in urine that was immediately acidified and analysed. Consequently, the ratio using AFMU was lower than that using total AAMU following transformation of AFMU in basic conditions. The proportion of AFMU in urine analysed immediately expressed as AFMU/(AFMU+AAMU) ratio did not correlate with urine pH, but was a function of the acetylation phenotype, with a low intergroup variability (64 +/- 3% and 32 +/- 5%, for rapid and slow acetylators, respectively; P < 0.00001, anova). Regarding CYP1A2 activity, a good correlation (r = 0.99) was observed between the metabolite ratios calculated from AFMU and AAMU, although the ratios calculated from AFMU were proportionately and systematically lower P < 0.00001, paired t-test, slope 1.2). This study demonstrates that both AFMU and AAMU can be used for NAT2 and CYP1A2 metabolite ratio determinations. The reported conversion of AFMU into AAMU is unlikely to explain the large amount of AAMU in urine that was acidified and analysed immediately after voiding. The results suggest that AAMU is formed not solely through a nonenzymatic hydrolysis in urine, but in vivo by a NAT2 phenotype-dependent pathway.},

First, to assess the potential of omeprazole to induce CYP1A2 activity, a caffeine test was performed in 27 subjects on two occasions: before and after 14 days on omeprazole (20 mg/day). Samples of urine were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to quantify caffeine and metabolites used to calculate the different caffeine MRs. MR1, MR3, and MR4 were enhanced after treatment; the percentage of change was inversely associated with that of the urine flow, with r values of -0.48, -0.49, and -0.47, respectively. However, MR2 or MR5 were not modified. To determine the reason for these contradictory results, the authors analyzed data of metabolites, ratios, and their components (numerators and denominators) from 152 subjects (who underwent one caffeine test) and their relationship with the urinary flow. Caffeine concentration in urine was the only compound nondependent on the urine flow. Consistently, ratios containing caffeine (MR1, MR3, and MR4) were highly influenced by the rate of urine excretion, since the flow dependence of their numerators is not canceled out by that of caffeine in their denominators. The dependency of the caffeine excretion on renal factors may explain the opposite results found with the different ratios in the aforementioned prospective study of drug interaction, the absence of closer correlations of the five MRs to each other, the discrepancies about the type of frequency distribution of the different MRs (either normal or multimodal), and the higher sensitivity of MR2 to detect gender differences in CYP1A2 activity found in this study. In summary, the data clearly emphasize the need for a strict control of the liquid intake to avoid high urine flows when MRs containing caffeine are used to assess CYP1A2 activity, especially in studies of drug interactions.},

We investigated the disposition of oral ALP (1 mg) and CAF (100 mg) in 17 normal volunteers to establish and validate a procedure for the simultaneous assessment of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 enzyme activity. Nine received ALP alone, ALP and CAF and CAF alone in an open three-way crossover study to test for pharmacokinetic interaction. Four received ALP after a 2-day pretreatment with ketoconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, and four normal volunteers received ALP after 4 days of rifampin, an inducer of CYP3A4. AUC values of ALP and CAF administered alone were not different from AUC values when both drugs were administered combined, indicating that there is no metabolic interaction. The ratio formed of paraxanthine and CAF correlated significantly with systemic CAF clearance at 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h. There was a strong correlation between AUC values of ALP and CAF and the plasma concentration obtained 6, 8, 10, or 24 h after ingestion of the drug. Ketoconazole and rifampin pretreatment significantly changed AUC values of ALP (mean AUC values in microg/l h: ALP = 242.2, ALP + ketoconazole = 426.2, ALP + rifampin = 28.4, ANOVA F = 17.7, P < 0.001). We conclude that ALP and CAF can be administered simultaneously for the assessment of CYP activity.

We aimed to clarify the existence of a phenotypic polymorphism and explore the molecular basis of such a polymorphism. Ninety-two non-smoking individuals underwent caffeine phenotyping. The distribution of the 1,7-dimethylxanthine + 1,7-dimethyluracil/caffeine (17U + 17X/137X) ratio and log-transformed data were determined. Probit plots were constructed and the distribution fitted using maximum likelihood method. The CYP1A2 gene, including upstream regulatory regions, was examined for sequence polymorphisms using the single-strand conformation polymorphism technique in 19 individuals and by complete DNA sequencing in two individuals from the extremes of the distribution. We found a similar range (1.45-18.65) and median (6.7) for the 17U + 17X/137X ratio to that found in previous studies of non-smoking Caucasians and no effect of sex. The 17U + 17X/137X ratio gave a normal distribution when log-transformed. Maximum likelihood analysis showed that the log-normal and bimodal distributions had similar deviances but the log-normal distribution was favoured because it has fewer parameters. There was no evidence for significant DNA sequence differences between fast and slow metabolizers, although some differences from published sequences including a silent polymorhpism in exon 7 which were unlikely to be of functional significance were found. We therefore conclude that CYP1A2 does not show functionally significant polymorphism but that the wide interindividual variation in activity may be due to environmental factors.},

This open-label study evaluated the effect of steady-state venlafaxine on CYP1A2-dependent metabolism, as measured by the pharmacokinetic disposition of caffeine, and urinary caffeine metabolite ratios (CMRs). Sixteen healthy subjects received 200 mg of caffeine orally before (Day 1) and after (Day 8) venlafaxine was titrated to steady-state (37.5 mg every 12 hours on Days 2-4, then 75 mg every 12 hours on Days 5-8). Samples were collected before and for 24 hours after caffeine dosing for the determination of caffeine in plasma and 1,7-dimethylxanthine, 3,7-dimethylxanthine, 1,7-dimethyluric acid (17U), 1-methylxanthine (1X) and 1-methyluric acid (1U), and 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil (AAMU) in urine. Blood samples were obtained before venlafaxine doses on Days 7 and 8 (morning dose only) for the determination of trough venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine levels. Venlafaxine did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of caffeine and its metabolites. Plasma caffeine AUC was unchanged and remained within the bioequivalence criteria (90% confidence interval: 87.9%-102%) in the presence of venlafaxine. Urine metabolite data showed variable increases and decreases in the CMR [(AAMU + 1U + 1X)/17U] for individual subjects. However, the mean CMR was altered by < 10% in the presence of venlafaxine. This in vivo study demonstrated that venlafaxine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of caffeine and confirms in vitro data that venlafaxine does not inhibit CYP1A2 metabolism. Therefore, venlafaxine appears to have a relatively low potential for drug interactions based on CYP1A2 inhibition.},

One hundred twenty-five healthy volunteers (59 nonsmokers and 66 smokers) were included in the study. All ratios showed a log-normal distribution. MR2 in the two time intervals was the only ratio nondependent on the urine flow. Differences between nonsmokers and smokers could be detected with all ratios at 4-5 h. However, only MR2 and, to a lesser extent, MR5 allowed the discrimination of higher cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) activity in smokers in the 0-24 h sample. Although smokers had increased urinary mutagenicity in relation to nonsmokers, a significant association between MRs and urine mutagenicity was observed only with MR2 in the 4-5 h interval; this ratio/time schedule being that of higher association with tobacco consumption. The most flow-dependent ratios, MR1, MR3, and MR4, were closely correlated with each other at the two intervals. The flow dependency profile of each ratio may explain their different power to indicate both tobacco exposure and tobacco-derived mutagenicity. In conclusion, MR2 in the period of 4-5 h after caffeine intake seems preferable, especially at high urine flow rates.},

Ten white men were given 2 mg/kg caffeine orally every 14 days for 3 months. The same dosage of caffeine was given to 10 premenopausal white women during the midfollicular and midluteal phases of three complete menstrual cycles. Phenotype was determined with urinary caffeine metabolite ratios. For CYP1A2, mean metabolic ratio (+/- SD) was 5.97 +/- 2.78 during the midfollicular phase and 5.32 +/- 1.99 during the midluteal phase (p = 0.2). For extensive and poor metabolizer of NAT2. Mean midfollicular phase metabolite ratios were 0.71 +/- 0.060 and 0.37 +/- 0.030, and mean midluteal phase metabolite ratios were 0.69 +/- 0.076 and 0.39 +/- 0.053 (p = 0.9). For xanthine oxidase, mean midfollicular phase metabolite ratio was 0.63 +/- 0.06 and mean midluteal phase metabolite ratio was 0.63 +/- 0.05 (p = 0.3). Among the men, mean CYP1A2, NAT2 rapid and slow acetylator, and xanthine oxidase indices were 9.42 +/- 10.18, 0.66 +/- 0.021, 0.31 +/- 0.056, and 0.64 +/- 0.03. There were no differences in metabolite ratios between men and women for CYP1A2, NAT2 extensive metabolizers, or xanthine oxidase. A statistically significant sex difference was found for poor metabolizers of NAT2 (p < 0.05). Median coefficients of variation for CYP1A2, NAT2 extensive and poor metabolizers, and xanthine oxidase ratios were 16.8% (range, 4.5% to 49.3%), 2.9% (range, 2.2% to 4.7%), 13.4% (range, 7.5% to 27.2%), and 4.5% (range, 2.3% to 13.0%). Stratification by menstrual cycle phase or sex need not be performed for pharmacokinetic or clinical investigations of substrates for CYP1A2, NAT2, or xanthine oxidase in which the subject are adults.},

No parameter that could affect the pharmacokinetics differed between CYP1A2-/-and wild-type mice such as creatinine for kidney function; alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin for liver function; or albumin for protein binding. Other P450s CYP2A, 2B, 2C, 2EI, and 3A were also unchanged in the knockout animals. Caffeine 3-demethylated metabolites thought previously to be characteristic of CYP1A2 (especially 1-methylxanthine and I-methylurate) were also found in the urines of the CYP1A2-/-animals, although at 40% of the level found in wild-type mice. These data indicate that the clearance of caffeine in wild-type mice is primarily determined by CYP1A2.},

A total of 218 toxic effects were self-reported by eighty-two (68%) subjects. Females and nonsmokers were at the highest risk (chi-square test, P = 0.01). Furthermore, two nonsmoking females experienced a symptomatology with delirium, restlessness, muscle tremor, vomiting and wakefulness. Among females and nonsmokers, those subjects who experienced toxic effects had lower caffeine N3-demethylation index (CYP1A2 activity) compared with unaffected females (1.87 +/- 0.51 vs 1.47 +/- 0.27, P < 0.0005) and nonsmokers (1.69 +/- 0.23 vs 1.49 +/- 0.31, P < 0.02). Caffeine N1- and N7-demethylations indices were also lower among females (P < 0.0005) and nonsmokers (P < 0.02) who reported toxic symptoms.

  abstract        = {CYP1A2 is a cytochrome P450 which is inducible by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This induction could be mediated via the Ah locus, which encodes a cytosolic receptor responsible for the regulation of the CYP1A1 gene. Enzyme activity in vivo can be measured by the urinary caffeine metabolite ratio (AFMU + 1X + 1U)/17U. Our goal was to determine, using this ratio, the possible existence of a genetic polymorphism in CYP1A2 induction. For this purpose, a population and family study, including smokers, were undertaken. In a first step, we investigated factors influencing enzyme activity in a population of 245 unrelated individuals. The induction effect of smoking and inhibiting effect of oral contraceptive use were confirmed. None of the other factors examined (age, sex, level of cigarette consumption, nicotine or tar amounts, filter, inhalation) accounted for the interindividual variability in the metabolic ratio. Using the statistical SKUMIX method, a unimodal (one peak) distribution of the ratio was concluded in 164 unrelated smokers, since a second distribution did not significantly improve the fit to the data (chi 2(1) = 1.39, P > 0.2). Segregation analysis was performed on 68 nuclear families and no major gene effect could be shown. Furthermore, the polygenic model did not provide a higher likelihood than the sporadic one, which argues against the existence of any familial resemblance. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that some environmental factors could obscure the phenotypes and occult a genetic determinism, we conclude that genetic factors are probably negligible in the determination of CYP1A2 activity measured by this method.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Urine specimen obtained at a 4-5-h interval after caffeine ingestion from 205 Japanese were analyzed using the [1,7-dimethyluric acid + 1,7-dimethylxanthine]/caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) ratio, which better correlated with the rate constant for caffeine 3-demethylation than other ratios. The probit analyses of nonsmokers (n = 147) and smokers (n = 58) suggested that the CYP1A2 activity was not normally distributed and appeared bimodal. The breakpoints were at 5.0 and 6.0 of (1,7-dimethyluric acid + 1,7-dimethylxanthine)/1,3,7-trimethylxanthine ratio in nonsmokers and smokers, respectively. The bimodal probit plot suggested the existence of poor and extensive phenotypes. The percentage of individuals with the poor phenotype in Japanese was 14.1%. Induction of CYP1A2 by cigarette smoking was confirmed by the higher molar ratio observed in smokers (P < 0.0001). The CYP1A2 ratio was also higher in males than in females (P = 0.04). A reproducibility study of 12 subjects in an 11 month interval period showed that intraindividual variability did not alter this CYP1A2 phenotypic classification. Family study in eight pedigrees suggested that the poor phenotype of CYP1A2 inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The sequences of CYP1A2 gene from poor and extensive metabolizers were analyzed. Although no differences of nucleotide sequence were observed in exons, exon-intron junctions and 5'-flanking regions (up to -2.6 kilobases) of CYP1A2 gene between each phenotype, there were some sequences which differed from the previous reported data. This is the first report in which the CYP1A2 phenotype and a genetic polymorphism in the CYP1A2 gene were comparably investigated.},

Following a standardized dose, caffeine (137X) and its metabolites were measured in urine and plasma of 39 healthy subjects. The measurements allowed determinations of: (1) systemic caffeine clearance (CL(caff)); (2) the caffeine metabolite ratio (AFMU + 1X + 1U)/17U determined in an overnight-urine specimen and referred to as CMR, and (3) the ratio (17X + 17U)/137X measured in urine collected between 4 and 5 h after caffeine intake and referred to as PCUR for 'paraxanthine-caffeine urinary ratio'. The PCUR showed a bimodal distribution and a relatively wide variation, CL(caff) and CMR were both normally distributed. The correlation between CL(caff) and CMR was r = 0.77 (p < 0.001), between CLcaff and PCUR r = 0.46 (p < 0.01), and between CMR and PCUR r = 0.40 (p < 0.02). The difference between the correlation coefficients 0.77 and 0.46 was statistically significant (z-test; p < 0.05). The well established decrease of caffeine metabolism by oral contraceptive use was observed with both CL(caff) and CMR but not with PCUR. Examination of possible explanations for the differences between PCUR and CMR led to the finding of a correlation between PCUR and the renal clearance of caffeine (CLr) with r = -0.47 (p < 0.01). Further scrutiny demonstrated that a bimodal or non-normal frequency distribution as shown by PCUR was also shown by CLr and by urine flow rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract        = {1. The effects of grapefruit juice and naringenin on the activity of the human cytochrome P450 isoform CYP1A2 were evaluated using caffeine as a probe substrate. 2. In vitro naringin was a potent competitive inhibitor of caffeine 3-demethylation by human liver microsomes (Ki = 7-29 microM). 3. In vivo grapefruit juice (1.2 l day-1 containing 0.5 g l-1 naringin, the glycone form of naringenin) decreased the oral clearance of caffeine by 23% (95% CI: 7%-30%) and prolonged its half-life by 31% (95% CI: 20%-44%) (n = 12). 4. We conclude that grapefruit juice and naringenin inhibit CYP1A2 activity in man. However, the small effect on caffeine clearance in vivo suggests that in general the ingestion of grapefruit juice should not cause clinically significant inhibition of the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYPIA2.},

There was a linear relationship between caffeine concentrations in the two fluids. Mean (+/- SE) saliva: total plasma concentration ratio was 0.79 +/- 0.02, while the ratio of the free (non-protein bound):total concentration of drug in plasma was 0.59 +/- 0.01. We postulate that the higher saliva:total plasma ratio as compared to the plasma free: total ratio is a result of pH partitioning. The mean elimination t 1/2 estimated from plasma and saliva concentration-time curves were much the same (5.7 +/- 0.7 and 5.9 +/- 0.8 hr). Values for total body clearance and apparent volume of distribution obtained from saliva data were higher than values derived from plasma concentrations. These differences could be corrected by multiplying the saliva-derived parameters by the saliva: total plasma concentration ratio. We conclude that saliva sampling could serve as a useful technique for therapeutic drug monitoring as well as for research of caffeine kinetics when many samples are required.},

In this study, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method using a dual-extraction approach was developed and validated to quantify 5 selective substrates and their metabolites for the simultaneous phenotyping CYPs 1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6, and 3A4 in patient blood samples. The assay was applied in a pilot study of 11 patients with schizophrenia. Five blood samples were collected before and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration of a phenotyping cocktail consisting of 100 mg caffeine, 20 mg omeprazole, 25 mg losartan, 30 mg dextromethorphan, and 2 mg midazolam. The method successfully quantitated the CYP enzyme activities without serious side effects in patients. The ratios of metabolite to parent area under the concentration-time curve values were calculated over the 6-hour postdosage to reflect CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 activities. The ratios of metabolite to parent plasma concentrations were calculated at 4-hour postdosage for CYP1A2 and at 4- or 6-hour postdose for CYP2C19, respectively. The plasma concentration of midazolam at 4 hours was also estimated as another phenotyping index for CYP3A4 activity. The simultaneous assay of all these analytes in a single matrix (plasma) will increase the feasibility of CYP phenotyping in patients.},

In accord with predictions from single dose studies, steady state was achieved on the first day following the administration of 90 mg and maintained by subsequent daily doses of 30 mg. When corrected for body weight there were no significant differences in minimum and maximum plateau levels of furafylline between males (1.2-2.0 micrograms ml-1; mean body weight 67.2 kg) and females (1.6-2.6 micrograms ml-1; mean body weight 54.9 kg). The half-life of elimination was less when the plasma concentration was lower than 600 ng ml-1 than during the stationary phase of treatment. Despite constant plasma levels the repeated administration of furafylline appeared to be associated with the onset of adverse xanthine-like side effects, a finding which was subsequently traced to the presence of, and possible synergism with, accumulating serum levels of caffeine in those volunteers drinking caffeine containing beverages. Subsequent studies showed that a single dose (90 mg) of furafylline results in a rapid accumulation of caffeine given orally (100 mg twice daily) and that this is accompanied by an elimination half-life of some 50 h and an abrupt decrease in metabolite levels. The furafylline-induced accumulation of caffeine was not influenced by the smoking habits of the subjects, implying that the metabolite pathway blocked by furafylline is the demethylation of caffeine in position 3, an implication confirmed by the reduced formation of paraxanthine.

Quinolones altered the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, with a significant increase in the AUCs and a decrease in plasma clearance. The elimination half-life increased significantly with pipemidic acid. The apparent volume of distribution, mean renal clearance, and time to reach maximum caffeine concentrations remained unaltered. There was a decline in caffeine metabolite levels in the 24-hour urine samples for both quinolone treatments, suggesting that pipemidic acid and, to a lesser degree, norfloxacin inhibit metabolism of the N-demethylation pathways of caffeine. The practical consequence of this observation could be caffeine accumulation during repeated intake of coffee. In two additional healthy volunteers under a controlled multiple-dose regimen of caffeine ingestion, administration of pipemidic acid for 2 days caused a fourfold increase in the plasma concentrations of caffeine.},

These complex changes in the pharmacokinetics of caffeine were analyzed experimentally and from published reports in order to determine the nature of the interaction, which is thought to be due to inhibition of caffeine metabolism by quinolones. A simple pharmacokinetic model for the caffeine-quinolone interaction was developed, which provides a unified method for evaluation and comparison of the effect of quinolones on the disposition of caffeine. The model is applicable to other methylxanthines, such as theophylline. The relative potency of the interactions of quinolones with caffeine in humans has been established as enoxacin (100), pipemidic acid (29), ciprofloxacin (11), norfloxacin (9) and ofloxacin (0).},

Lomefloxacin (400 mg) or placebo was administered orally once daily for 5 days to xanthine-free volunteers after an overnight fast. Caffeine (200 mg orally) was administered simultaneously with lomefloxacin on days 3 through 5. After a 2-day washout period, subjects were crossed over to the alternate 5-day regimen with caffeine, which was again given on the final 3 days. Blood samples for caffeine, paraxanthine, and lomefloxacin concentration determinations were serially collected for 48 h following the last dose of each regimen. All compounds were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. For the placebo versus lomefloxacin-containing treatments, maximum caffeine concentrations in plasma (4.35 +/- 0.63 versus 4.07 +/- 0.56 micrograms/ml), areas under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 h at steady state (30.3 +/- 6.9 versus 29.7 +/- 6.6 micrograms.h/ml), and elimination half-lives of caffeine (4.8 +/- 1.1 versus 4.8 +/- 1.2 h) were not significantly different. In addition, there were no significant changes in the disposition parameters of paraxanthine as a result of lomefloxacin administration. The frequencies of central nervous system-related effects for the two treatments were not statistically different. We conclude that lomefloxacin has no significant effect on the disposition of caffeine in young healthy volunteers.},

In vivo studies involved an intraindividual comparison of the single-dose kinetics of caffeine before and during quinolone administration in 12 healthy men. Changes of enzymatic caffeine degradation by the quinolones were studied in vitro using human liver microsomes from three donors. Enoxacin and pipemidic acid markedly prolonged caffeine elimination in vivo. A positive correlation exists between the doses of enoxacin or ciprofloxacin and the prolongation (increases) in the caffeine elimination half-life. Decreases in caffeine elimination, using doses of ciprofloxacin in the upper part of the recommended dose range, were approximately 1.5-fold in comparison with untreated control subjects, whereas in the case of enoxacin there was a sixfold change. In vitro results with enoxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and pipemidic acid show a competitive inhibition (Dixon plots) of caffeine 3-demethylation. Ciprofloxacin and enoxacin showed the strongest inhibitory effects in vitro, whereas ofloxacin had the lowest inhibitory effect. These results are qualitatively reflected in the in vivo results; however, the clinical effects may be dependent on pharmacokinetic disposition of the quinolone and this could explain the weak inhibitory action of ciprofloxacin in vivo.},

  abstract        = {Caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline are among the most widely consumed compounds in beverages and in pharmaceutical preparations. These methylxanthine alkaloids are metabolized by similar pathways involving demethylation and hydroxylation that are predominantly cytochrome P-450 mediated. In vivo and in vitro evidence suggests that the cytochrome P-450 isozymes involved in the demethylation pathways are distinct from the cytochrome P-450 isozymes involved in the hydroxylation pathways. Although distinctions can be made between demethylation and hydroxylation pathways, the evidence suggests that these different cytochrome P-450 isozymes are under common regulatory control. Any drug inhibiting the family of cytochrome P-450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of the methylxanthines would, therefore, be expected to have a similar effect on theophylline, theobromine, and caffeine. A number of quinolones, including enoxacin, pipemidic acid, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and pefloxacin, have been shown to reduce the clearance of theophylline, while lomefloxacin has no effect on theophylline or caffeine clearance. It has been hypothesized that only fluoroquinolones that form a 4-oxo-metabolite inhibit theophylline clearance. Lomefloxacin, which does not form a 4-oxo-metabolite, would therefore not be expected to inhibit the clearance of theophylline or caffeine. In contrast, ciprofloxacin, which does form a 4-oxo-metabolite, has been shown to reduce theophylline and caffeine clearances by about one third. Another hypothesis for the differences among quinolones suggests that quinolones that have a greater impact on theophylline clearances are more stereochemically similar to theophylline. Substitutions at position 8 on the quinolone nucleus (as in lomefloxacin) would result in stearic hindrance and decrease the structural similarity to theophylline.},

Blood samples were serially collected after both doses of caffeine and after the first and last doses of ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin significantly increased the half-life of caffeine (from 5.2 +/- 1.2 to 8.2 +/- 2.5 h) and the area under the caffeine concentration-time curve (from 16.3 +/- 6.6 to 25.9 +/- 7.8 micrograms.h/ml) while decreasing the total body clearance (from 106 +/- 41.6 to 58.2 +/- 28.8 ml/min per 1.73 m2). In addition, the rate of conversion of caffeine to paraxanthine was significantly delayed. There was no significant linear correlation between the urinary recovery of oxociprofloxacin at 0 to 12 h and the change in the area under the caffeine concentration-time curve. There was also a small but statistically significant increase in the area under the ciprofloxacin concentration-time curve during simultaneous administration of caffeine. We concluded that ciprofloxacin causes a significant increase in the half-life of caffeine and in the area under the caffeine concentration-time curve by reducing total body clearance. This interaction is due at least in part to a delay in the conversion of caffeine to paraxanthine. The clinical significance of these observations remains to be determined. Lastly, caffeine may alter the kinetics of ciprofloxacin, a possibility which should be more fully explored.},

The participants' covariates, including age, body weight, and regularity of caffeinated-beverage consumption or smoking, were analysed in a stepwise fashion to identify their potential influence on caffeine pharmacokinetics. The final pharmacostatistical model was then subjected to stochastic simulation to predict the plasma concentrations of caffeine after oral (204, 340 and 476 mg) dosing regimens (repeated dosing every 6, 8 or 12 h) over a hypothetical 3-day period. The data were best described by a one-compartmental model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination. Smoking status was an influential covariate for clearance: clearance (mL/min) = 110*SMOKE + 114, where SMOKE was 0 and 1 for the non-smoker and the smoker respectively. Interoccasion variability was smaller compared to interindividual variability in clearance, volume and absorption rate (27% vs. 33%, 10% vs. 15% and 23% vs. 51% respectively). The extrapolated elimination half-lives of caffeine in the non-smokers and the smokers were 4.3 +/- 1.5 and 3.0 +/- 0.7 h respectively. Dosing simulations indicated that dosing regimens of 340 mg (repeated every 8 h) and 476 mg (repeated every 6 h) should achieve population-averaged caffeine concentrations within the reported beneficial range (4.5-9 microg/mL) in the non-smokers and the smokers respectively over 72 h. The population pharmacokinetic model satisfactorily described the disposition and variability of caffeine in the data. Mixed-effects modelling showed that the dose of caffeine depended on cigarette smoking status.},

  abstract        = {This study examined the exercise responses of well-trained endurance athletes to various doses of caffeine to evaluate the impact of the drug on exercise metabolism and endurance capacity. Subjects (n = 8) withdrew from all dietary sources of caffeine for 48 h before each of four tests. One hour before exercise they ingested capsules of placebo or caffeine (3, 6, or 9 mg/kg), rested quietly, and then ran at 85% of maximal O2 consumption to voluntary exhaustion. Blood samples for methylxanthine, catecholamine, glucose, lactate, free fatty acid, and glycerol analyses were taken every 15 min. Plasma caffeine concentration increased with each dose (P < 0.05). Its major metabolite, paraxanthine, did not increase between the 6 and 9 mg/kg doses, suggesting that hepatic caffeine metabolism was saturated. Endurance was enhanced with both 3 and 6 mg/kg of caffeine (increases of 22 +/- 9 and 22 +/- 7%, respectively; both P < 0.05) over the placebo time of 49.4 +/- 4.2 min, whereas there was no significant effect with 9 mg/kg of caffeine. In contrast, plasma epinephrine was not increased with 3 mg/kg of caffeine but was greater with the higher doses (P < 0.05). Similarly only the highest dose of caffeine resulted in increases in glycerol and free fatty acids (P < 0.05). Thus the highest dose had the greatest effect on epinephrine and blood-borne metabolites yet had the least effect on performance. The lowest dose had little or no effect on epinephrine and metabolites but did have an ergogenic effect. These results are not compatible with the traditional theory that caffeine mediates its ergogenic effect via enhanced catecholamines.},

Caffeine kinetics were nonlinear, with clearance significantly reduced and elimination half-life prolonged at the 500-mg compared to the 250-mg dose. The lower dose of caffeine produced more favorable subjective effects than the higher dose (elation, peacefulness, pleasantness), whereas unpleasant effects (tension, nervousness, anxiety, excitement, irritability, nausea, palpitations, restlessness) following the 500-mg dose exceeded those of the 250-mg dose. The lower dose of caffeine enhanced performance on the digit symbol substitution test and a tapping speed test compared to placebo; high-dose caffeine produced less performance enhancement than the lower dose. The plasma concentration versus response relationship revealed concentration-dependent increases in anxiety and improvements in cognitive and motor performance at low to intermediate concentrations. Both caffeine doses reduced electroencephalographic amplitude over the 4 Hz to 30 Hz spectrum, as well as in the alpha (8-11 Hz) and beta (12-30 Hz) ranges; however, effects were not dose-dependent. While favorable subjective and performance-enhancing stimulant effects occur at low to intermediate caffeine doses, the unfavorable subjective and somatic effects, as well as performance disruption, from high doses of caffeine may intrinsically limit the doses of caffeine used in the general population.},

Other dose-related effects were an increase in skin conductance level (sweat-gland activity) and self rating of alertness. Ratings of headache and tiredness were decreased by the caffeine.

We attempted to validate the effectiveness of successive salivary caffeine tests establishing the time for cimetidine to inhibit hepatic metabolism. The time of cimetidine's inhibitory effect as reported in other studies was chosen as the reference. In this open-label, prospective longitudinal, 16-day study, five healthy volunteers were treated with cimetidine 1 g/day for 5 days. After the intake of caffeine 300 mg, salivary caffeine tests were carried out on days -1 (control value), 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16. The mean systemic caffeine clearance was decreased after 24 hours of cimetidine. The drug's maximum inhibitory effect was reached after 5 days of administration, returning to previous values progressively 1-7 days after discontinuing cimetidine. No change occurred in the apparent volume of distribution. The time course of cimetidine's inhibitory effect was similar to that described with other methodologies. Although this was a pilot trial and the results have to be confirmed, it seems that successive salivary caffeine measurements could be a safe, reliable, noninvasive test for exploring the time course of the inhibitory effects of drugs on hepatic metabolism.},

These compounds were further degraded to dimethylated uric acids, monomethylxanthines and monomethyluric acids. About 3 and 6% of the drug was converted to theophylline and theobromine, respectively. The elimination of paraxanthine after its formation did not follow linear kinetics. A large urine recovery of 1-methylxanthine after caffeine administration in comparison with the amount recovered after administration of theophylline suggests an inhibitory effect on the degradation of this metabolite by either caffeine itself or another metabolite of caffeine. Caffeine and its primary metabolites, dimethylxanthines, were extensively reabsorbed in the renal tubule. Their renal clearances were highly urine flow-dependent and their urinary excretion varied with urine output during the study. About 70% of the dose was recovered in the urine. Postulated degradation pathways of caffeine are discussed.},

  abstract        = {1. The clearance and biotransformation of caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) were investigated in eight healthy control subjects and 16 patients with cirrhosis, by measuring serial serum caffeine concentrations and recoveries of methylxanthine metabolites in urine for 48 h after a 400 mg oral caffeine load. 2. In the control group, the mean (+/- SD) serum caffeine clearance was 1.3 +/- 0.4 ml min-1 kg-1 and a mean of 56.4 +/- 16.5% of the administered caffeine was recovered from the urine over 48 h as methyluric acids and methylxanthines. The majority of the metabolites were excreted in the first 24 h period and only 2.0 +/- 1.4% of the administered caffeine was excreted unchanged. 3. Patients with compensated cirrhosis (n = 10) metabolized caffeine similarly to the control subjects. Thus the mean serum caffeine clearance was 1.4 +/- 1.2 ml min-1 kg-1 and a mean of 57.2 +/- 11.7% of the administered caffeine was recovered from the urine over 48 h. The majority of the metabolites were excreted in the first 24 h; the pattern of metabolic excretion was unaltered and only 2.2 +/- 0.9% of the administered caffeine was excreted unchanged. 4. In the patients with decompensated cirrhosis (n = 6), significant changes were observed in caffeine metabolism. The mean serum caffeine clearance (0.4 +/- 0.2 ml min-1 kg-1) was significantly impaired compared with controls (P less than 0.01) and a significant delay was observed in metabolite excretion in the urine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract        = {A number of caffeine metabolite ratios (CMRs) have been proposed to measure CYP1A2 activity in vivo. The effect of liver disease on these ratios is not clear. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of liver disease on caffeine metabolite ratios. Two studies were performed. First, in healthy control subjects and in subjects with cirrhosis, caffeine clearance was measured by intravenous infusion of stable isotope-labeled caffeine while subjects consumed oral caffeine. Second, spot urine samples were collected from control subjects and from subjects with either chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis while they consumed caffeine. In study 1, caffeine clearance was decreased in subjects with cirrhosis (control mean, 0.14 L/hr/kg; cirrhosis mean, 0.04 L/hr/kg; p = 0.003). CMRs were affected by liver disease (e.g., ratio characterizing paraxanthine demethylation [AAMU + 1X + 1U/17U], control median, 8.3; cirrhosis median, 6.2; p = 0.005). AAMU + 1X + 1U/17U correlated significantly with caffeine clearance in the control group (r2 = 0.68; p = 0.0001) and in subjects with cirrhosis (r2 = 0.41; p = 0.05). In study 2, there was a significant difference between control subjects and subjects with cirrhosis for AAMU + 1X + 1U/17U (median for control subjects, 6.2; median for subjects with cirrhosis, 4.3; p = 0.001) but not between control subjects and patients with chronic hepatitis. We conclude that AAMU + 1X + 1U/17U is affected by liver disease and reflects the decrease in CYP1A2 activity in subjects with cirrhosis. AAMU + 1X + 1U/17U measured from a spot urine sample reflects caffeine clearance in subjects with cirrhosis and may be useful as a hepatic function test. Despite the large interindividual variation observed, the test can be repeated easily in the same patient and an individual patient's decline in CYP1A2 activity, such as in patients with progressively deteriorating liver function, can be monitored.},

  abstract      = {The human drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, is one of the major P450 isoforms contributing by about 5-20% to the hepatic P450 pool and catalyzing oxidative biotransformation of up to 10% of clinically relevant drugs including clozapine and caffeine. CYP1A2 activity is interindividually highly variable and although twin studies have suggested a high heritability, underlying genetic factors are still unknown. Here we adopted a pathway-oriented approach using a large human liver bank (n = 150) to elucidate whether variants in candidate genes of constitutive, ligand-inducible, and pathophysiological inhibitory regulatory pathways may explain different hepatic CYP1A2 phenotypes. Samples were phenotyped for phenacetin O-deethylase activity, and the expression of CYP1A2 protein and mRNA was determined. CYP1A2 expression and function was increased in smokers and decreased in patients with inflammation and cholestasis. Of 169 SNPs in 17 candidate genes including the CYP1A locus, 136 non-redundant SNPs with minor allele frequency >5% were analyzed by univariate and multivariate methods. A total of 13 strong significant associations were identified, of which 10 SNPs in the ARNT, AhRR, HNF1α, IL1β, SRC-1, and VDR genes showed consistent changes for at least two phenotypes by univariate analysis. Multivariate linear modeling indicated that the polymorphisms and non-genetic factors together explained 42, 38, and 33% of CYP1A2 variation at activity, protein and mRNA levels, respectively. In conclusion, we identified novel trans-associations between regulatory genes and hepatic CYP1A2 function and expression, but additional genetic factors must be assumed to explain the full extent of CYP1A2 heritability.},

  abstract        = {The genotype responsible for more than 60-fold interindividual differences in human hepatic CYP1A2 constitutive expression is not understood. Resequencing the human CYP1A1_CYP1A2 locus (39.6 kb) in five major geographically isolated subgroups recently led to the identification of 85 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 57 of which were double-hit SNPs. Here, we attempted to correlate the CYP1A2 genotype with a metabolic phenotype. We chose 16 SNPs (all having a minor allele frequency > or =0.05 in Caucasians) to genotype 32 DNA samples (26 Caucasians, six Ethiopians) in which CYP1A2 metabolism had previously been determined. From 280 subjects (five locations worldwide) that had been CYP1A2-phenotyped, we genotyped the 10 highest, 14 lowest and eight intermediate DNA samples. Although no SNP was significant (P<0.05), possibly due to the small sample size, we found a trend for several of the six SNPs across the CYP1A2 linkage disequilibrium block associated with the trait. Five CYP1A2 haplotypes were inferred, two of which had not previously been reported; haplotype 1A2H10 showed the greatest association with CYP1A2 activity. Regulatory sequences responsible for the large interindividual differences in hepatic CYP1A2 gene basal expression might reside, in part, with some of these CYP1A2 SNPS but, in large part, might be located either cis (in nearby sequences not yet haplotyped) or trans in that they are not linked to the gene. We conclude that no SNP or haplotype in the CYP1A2 gene has yet been identified that can unequivocally be used to predict the metabolic phenotype in any individual patient.},
