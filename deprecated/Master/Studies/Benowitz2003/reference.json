    "abstract": "This study provides novel evidence that cigarette smoking accelerates chlorzoxazone metabolism, most likely reflecting induction of CYP2E1 activity, in humans. Induction of CYP2E1 activity by cigarette smoking could contribute to tobacco-induced cancer, alcohol-induced liver disease, and the risk of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity.",
