Chiew2010	21143403		This was a prospective, non-blinded, randomized, cross over trial involving nine healthy volunteers.	Comparison of Panadol Extend (PEx), a modified-release formula of paracetamol with paracetamol. Pharmacokinetics of paracetamol, paracetamol glucuronide and paracetamol sulphate. Crossover study; The other formulation of paracetamol was ingested in the subsequent arm after at least a 1 week wash-out period.	"The subjects consisted of 8 men and 1 woman. The exclusion criteria of the study were pregnancy, pre-existing liver disease, chronic alcohol consumption greater than 20 g per day, any chronic illness, use of any regular medication, body weight more than 100 kg, use of paracetamol products in the 7 days before participation in the study, and any abnormality in liver function tests performed 1 week before the study and 3 days after the first arm of the study.
On the day of the study, subjects were fasted from midnight and weighed.
Demographic characteristics listed in Table 2."	"Panadol Extend (GlaxoSmithKline, Ermington, NSW, Australia) or APAP-IR (Panadol 500 mg: tablets, GlaxoSmith-Kline).
Subjects received a dose of 80 mg/kg of paracetamol preparation as close as possible in whole tablets. Subjects remained fasted for 2 h after administration of the paracetamol product. At time zero, patients were randomized to take one of the paracetamol formulations and blood was collected at time zero and paracetamol product administered. Blood samples were then collected at 30, 45, 60, 90 min and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 h post-ingestion in all subjects. Six subjects also had samples taken at 16 and 24 h as analysis of the first three subjects, detected significant amounts of paracetamol metabolite present at 12 h post-ingestion.

Chan1997	9248766		Comparison of paracetamol pharmacokinetics between groups of different renal impairments in T2DM. Single-dose pharmacokinetics of paracetamol and its conjugates in Chinese non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients with renal impairment.		"A single oral dose of paracetamol (20 mg/kg) was given to 38 Chinese patients with non-
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) who had either normal renal function or varying degrees of renal impairment, with creatinine clearances ranging from 4 to 123 ml/min/1.73 m^2.
Of the 38 patients, 20 were male. Mean age was 58 (11) years (range 34±75 years). The mean duration of diagnosed diabetes was 8.1 (3.9) years. There were no significant differences in age, sex and body mass index between the four groups.
All patients abstained from taking paracetamol-containing drugs for 2 weeks prior to the study. Following overnight fasting, an oral dose of paracetamol syrup (Panadol, Sterling-Winthrop) 20 mg/kg was administered with 100 ml water."	Following overnight fasting, an oral dose of paracetamol syrup (Panadol, Sterling-Winthrop) 20 mg/kg was administered with 100 ml water.	
Critchley2005	15811172		Differences in the single-oral-dose pharmacokinetics and urinary excretion of paracetamol and its conjugates between Hong Kong Chinese and Caucasian subjects.		"Twenty healthy Chinese (n = 11) and Caucasian (n = 9) subjects, aged 21–44 years, 11 male and nine female, were given oral paracetamol syrup 20 mg/kg, following an overnight fast.
Eleven Chinese and nine Caucasian healthy local volunteers were recruited. The study was approved by the Chinese University Clinical Research Ethics Committee. All subjects abstained from taking paracetamol-containing and other drugs for 2 weeks prior to the study. Following an overnight fast, an oral dose of paracetamol syrup 20 mg/kg (Panadol, Sterling-Winthrop, New York, NY, USA) was administered with water (100 mL). Subjects then remained sedentary for 2 h.

Demographic data in Table 1.

The Chinese subjects were smaller, with respect to weight and height, compared with their Caucasian counterparts (P < 0Æ05) (Table 1)."	Given oral paracetamol syrup 20 mg/kg, following an overnight fast.	"AUC(0-inf); For paracetamol, the AUC was calculated using data collected between 0 and 8 h and extrapolated to infinity. For metabolites, AUCs were calculated between 0–24 h and extrapolated to infinity.

Renal clearances were calculated for
paracetamol and its metabolites from the 24-h urinary recoveries divided by AUC (0-inf) and expressed as mL/min."

Rawlins1977	862649	Pharmacokinetics of paracetamol (acetaminophen) after intravenous and oral administration.	Prospective, non-blinded trial. 6 healthy male subjects received different doses of paracetamol IV or oral.	Dosing variation	"6 healthy male subjects; 
All subjects denied having consumed any drug in the four weeks before the start of the project."	On separate occasions (at least one week apart) each volunteer received 1000mg paracetamol intravenously (as a 20 mg/ml solution over 5 minutes), and 500mg, 1000mg and 2000 mg orally as tablets (Panadol).	"The decline in plasma paracetamol concentration after intravenous administration appeared to be bi-exponential and the data was intepreted in form of a two compartment model.
The area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) was determined by the trapezoidal rule, and extrapolated to infinity; the latter never exceeded 15% of the total AUC.
The terminal (3-6 h) mono-exponential decline in plasma paracetamol concentration after oral dosing was used to calculate the oral half-life of the drug (T1/2).
Bioavailability (F) was determined as F=AUC_oral/AUC_iv * Dose_iv/Dose_oral.

Albert1974	4829520	Bioavailability studies of acetaminophen and nitrofurantoin.	Bioavailability studies of acetaminophen and nitrofurantoin. The studies were performed using a Latin-square crossover design with two groups of 5 subjects possessing similar average body weights.		10 healthy male volunteers were selected based upon criteria previously published.	"On the mornings acetaminophen was administered, each subject drank 6 fl oz of water within the first hour after arising and 6 fl oz of water when the medication was administered.
On each phase of the two-way crossover, each subject took two 325-mg capsules (treatment A) or two 325-mg tablets (treatment B), swallowing the preparations intact. (Treatment A was the soft gelatin capsule, R. P. Scherer Corp.; treatment B was Tylenol tablets, McNeil Laboratories)"	
Ameer1981	7320146	High-performance liquid chromatographic determination of acetaminophen in plasma: single-dose pharmacokinetic studies.			A healthy 26-year old male volunteer (68kg) participated.	He received single 650-mg doses of acetaminophen on two occasions separated by one week_ On one trial, a sterile solution of acetaminophen (13 ml of a 50 mg/mI solution [propylene glycol-ethyl alcohol-5% dextrose (40:10:50, v/v)] diluted to 50 ml with 5% dextrose) was infused into an antecubitat vein over a period of 5 min by a constant rate infusion pump. For the other trial, the subject ingested two 325-mg tablets of acetaminophen (Parke-Davis, Ann Arbor, MI, U.S.A.) in the fasting state with 100-200 ml of tap water.	"Plasma acetaminophen concentrations were analyzed by weighted iterative non-linear least-squares regression techniques described in detaiI previously [15]. After intravenous administration, data points were fitted to the following function:
C = A*exp(-alpha*t) + P*exp(-pi*t) + B*exp(-beta*t)
where C is the plasma acetaminophen concentration at time f after dosage. A, P, and B are hybrid intercept terms having units of concentration; they were appropriately corrected for the 5-min infusion period [16]. The exponents alpha, pi, and beta are hybrid quantities having units of reciprocal time.
Using standard pharmacokinetic methods [17], coefficients and exponents
from the fitted function were used to determine the foIlowing kinetic variables for acetaminophen: initial distribution half-life, intermediate distribution half-life, ehmination hallife, volume of the central compartment, total volume of distribution using the area method, and total clearance_ Assuming that all of acetaminophen clearance is accounted for by hepatic biotransformation, the predicted extraction ratio was calculated as the quotient of hepatic clearance and estimated hepatic blood flow (21 ml/mm/kg) [18].
After oral acetaminophen administration, plasma concentrations were
fitted to the following function:
C = -(A + B)*exp(-ka(t-t0)) + A*exp(-(alpha(t-t0)) + B*ep(-beta(t-t0)
where C is the plasma concentration at time f after dosage. As in eqn. 1,
A and B are hybrid intercept terms, and alpha and beta are hybrid exponents; ka is also a hybrid exponent, representing the apparent phase of drug absorption;
t0 is the Iag time elapsing prior to the start of first order absorption. The
absofute bioavaiIability of orally administered acetaminophen was calculated as the area under the plasma concentration curve (extrapolated to infinity) after oral dosage divided by the area under the curve following intravenous administration [17]."
Baraka1990	2306420	The effect of propranolol on paracetamol metabolism in man.	"Ten healthy volunteers were treated for 4 days with 160 mg propranolol HCl and placebo in random order. At the end of each treatment salivary antipyrine kinetics and the plasma kinetics and urinary excretion of paracetamol and its major metabolites were measured following a 1500 mg oral dose. 
The study was a double-blind, crossover investigation comprising two periods of 5 days each separated by 12 days. Subjects received in a random order either racemic propranolol HCI 80 mg or matched placebo tablets twice daily for 4 days. Subjects refrained from taking alcohol during the study and reported to the clinical laboratory at 09.00 h after an overnight fast on days 4 and 5 of each treatment period."	Ten healthy volunteers were treated for 4 days with 160 mg propranolol HCl and placebo in random order.	"6 males and 4 females, all clinically healthy, aged between 21 and 32 years and weighing from 51 to 85 kg (median 68 kg) participated in the study which was approved by the Bristol and Weston Health Authority Ethics Committee.
All were non-smokers, used alcohol in moderation and did not take other drugs, including the oral contraceptive."	"On day 4 a single oral dose of paracetamol
(1500 mg) was administered and the subjects continued to fast for 2 h.
Venous blood samples (5ml) were collected at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 12 and 24h. A complete urine collection was made for the first 24h following drug administration.
At the end of each treatment salivary antipyrine kinetics and the plasma kinetics and urinary excretion of paracetamol and its major metabolites were measured following a 1500 mg oral dose."	"The plasma elimination half-life (thalf) of paracetamol was computed by least squares linear regression of the terminal part of the log drug concentration-time curve. The area under the plasma drug concentration-time profile (AUC)
was calculated as follows: the area up to the end of sampling was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule and the remaining area was extrapolated to infinity using the terminal log drug concentration-time slope. The systemic clearance of paracetamol could not be assessed in the absence of a measurement of bioavailability.
However, the oral clearance (CLP,) was estimated from:
CLpo = Dose/AUC
The partial clearance of paracetamol to each of
its metabolites (CLm)was calculated from
CLm = Ae(m)/AUC
where Ae(m) = Amount of metabolite recovered
in urine.

The plasma concentration of paracetamol
reached a peak of 27.0 ± 10.8 ug/ml after
propranolol compared with 18.0 ± 6.1 µg/ml
following placebo (P < 0.01) (Figure 1). Propranolol increased the half-life of paracetamol from 2.7 ± 0.6 to 3.4 ± 0.3 h (P <0.05) andlowered its oral clearance from 364 ± 92 ml/min to 313 ± 28 ml/min (P < 0.05).
Propranolol decreased the partial clearance of
paracetamol to the oxidised metabolites - the
cysteine and mercapturate - by 16 ± 3% and 32 ± 7% (P < 0.05), respectively and to the
glucuronide by 27 ± 7% (P < 0.05)."
