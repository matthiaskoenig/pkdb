  abstract =    {There is relevant between individual variability in paracetamol clearance in young women. In this pooled study, we focused on the population pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous paracetamol metabolism and its covariates in young women.Population PK parameters using non-linear mixed effect modelling were estimated in a pooled dataset of plasma and urine PK studies in 69 young women [47 at delivery, 8/47 again 10-15 weeks after delivery (early postpartum), and 7/8 again 1 year after delivery (late postpartum), 22 healthy female volunteers with or without oral contraceptives].Population PK parameters were estimated based on 815 plasma samples and 101 urine collections. Compared to healthy female volunteers (reference group) not on oral contraceptives, being at delivery was the most significant covariate for clearance to paracetamol glucuronide (Factor = 2.03), while women in early postpartum had decreased paracetamol glucuronidation clearance (Factor = 0.55). Women on contraceptives showed increased paracetamol glucuronidation clearance (Factor = 1.46). The oestradiol level did not further affect this model. Being at delivery did not prove significant for clearance to paracetamol sulphate, but was higher in pregnant women who delivered preterm (<37 weeks, Factor = 1.34) compared to term delivery and non-pregnant women. Finally, clearance of unchanged paracetamol was dependent on urine flow rate.Compared to healthy female volunteers not on oral contraceptives, urine paracetamol glucuronidation elimination in young women is affected by pregnancy (higher), early postpartum (lower) or exposure to oral contraceptives (higher), resulting in at least a two fold variability in paracetamol clearance in young women.},

  abstract =    {The aims of this study were to describe paracetamol pharmacokinetics in neonates and infants.Infants in their first 3 months of life (n = 30) were randomised to sequentially receive one of three paracetamol formulations (dose 30-40 mg kg-1) over a 2 day period. The formulations were (a) elixir, (b) glycogelatin capsule suppository and (c) triglyceride base suppository. Approximately six blood samples were taken after each dose over the subsequent 10-16 h. Data were analysed using a nonlinear mixed effect model. These neonatal and infant data were then included with data from four published studies of paracetamol pharmacokinetics (n = 221) and age-related pharmacokinetic changes investigated.Population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates and their coefficients of variation (CV\%) for a one compartment model with first order input, lag time and first order elimination were volume of distribution 69.9 (18\%) l and clearance 13.0 (41\%) l h-1 (standardized to a 70 kg person). The volume of distribution decreased exponentially with a half-life of 1.9 days from 120 l 70 kg-1 at birth to 69.9 l 70 kg-1 by 14 days. Clearance increased from birth (4.9 l h-1 70 kg-1) with a half-life of 3.25 months to reach 12.4 l h-1 70 kg-1 by 12 months. The absorption half-life (tabs) for the oral preparation was 0.13 (154\%) h with a lag time (tlag) of 0.39 h (31\%). Absorption parameters for the triglyceride base and capsule suppositories were tabs 1.34 (90\%) h, tlag 0.14 h (31\%) and tabs 0.65 (63\%) h, tlag 0.54 h (31\%), respectively. The tabs for elixir and capsule suppository in children under 3 months were 3.68 and 1.51 times greater than children over 3 months. The relative bioavailability of rectal formulations compared with elixir were 0.67 (30\%) and 0.61 (23\%) for the triglyceride base and capsule suppositories, respectively.Total body clearance of paracetamol at birth is 62\% and volume of distribution 174\% that of older children. A target concentration above 10 mg l-1 in approximately 50\% subjects can be achieved by a dose from 45 mg kg-1 day-1 at birth and up to 90 mg kg-1 day-1 in 5-year-old children. A reduced dose of 75 mg kg-1 day-1 in an 8-year-old child is sufficient because clearance is a nonlinear function of weight.},

Propranolol prolonged the half-life of antipyrine by 11 +/- 5\% (mean +/- s.e. mean) and lowered its clearance by 14 +/- 3\% (P less than 0.05). Propranolol increased the half-life of paracetamol by 25 +/- 12\% (P less than 0.05) and lowered its clearance by 14 +/- 3\% (P less than 0.05). Propranolol decreased the partial clearance of paracetamol to its cysteine and mercapturate derivatives by 16 +/- 3\% (P less than 0.05) and 32 +/- 7\% (P less than 0.05), respectively. The partial clearance to the glucuronide conjugate was decreased by 27 +/- 6\% (P less than 0.05), whereas that to sulphate was not changed significantly. Propranolol inhibits paracetamol metabolism predominantly through inhibition of the oxidation and glucuronidation pathways.},

  abstract =    {Acetaminophen (N-acetyl-para-aminophenol) is the most widely used over-the-counter or prescription painkiller in the world. Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver where a toxic byproduct is produced that can be removed by conjugation with glutathione. Acetaminophen overdoses, either accidental or intentional, are the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States, accounting for 56,000 emergency room visits per year. The standard treatment for overdose is N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), which is given to stimulate the production of glutathione.We have created a mathematical model for acetaminophen transport and metabolism including the following compartments: gut, plasma, liver, tissue, urine. In the liver compartment the metabolism of acetaminophen includes sulfation, glucoronidation, conjugation with glutathione, production of the toxic metabolite, and liver damage, taking biochemical parameters from the literature whenever possible. This model is then connected to a previously constructed model of glutathione metabolism.We show that our model accurately reproduces published clinical and experimental data on the dose-dependent time course of acetaminophen in the plasma, the accumulation of acetaminophen and its metabolites in the urine, and the depletion of glutathione caused by conjugation with the toxic product. We use the model to study the extent of liver damage caused by overdoses or by chronic use of therapeutic doses, and the effects of polymorphisms in glucoronidation enzymes. We use the model to study the depletion of glutathione and the effect of the size and timing of N-acetyl-cysteine doses given as an antidote. Our model accurately predicts patient death or recovery depending on size of APAP overdose and time of treatment.The mathematical model provides a new tool for studying the effects of various doses of acetaminophen on the liver metabolism of acetaminophen and glutathione. It can be used to study how the metabolism of acetaminophen depends on the expression level of liver enzymes. Finally, it can be used to predict patient metabolic and physiological responses to APAP doses and different NAC dosing strategies.},

The plasma and urinary concentrations of paracetamol and its major metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).The absorption and elimination of paracetamol were unaffected by renal impairment. However, the area under the plasma concentration time curve and the elimination half-life of paracetamol metabolites increased significantly with worsening renal insufficiency. Mean renal clearances of paracetamol and its conjugates were significantly reduced in these subjects. There was no evidence of altered metabolic activation with renal impairment.The results demonstrate that paracetamol disposition is minimally affected by diabetic nephropathy; however, extensive accumulation of conjugates may occur.},

Br.), a cruciferous vegetable, on acetaminophen metabolism, the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen and its metabolites were studied in a crossover trial of human volunteers. A single oral dose of acetaminophen (1 gm) was given 10 hours after ingestion of watercress homogenates (50 gm). In comparison with acetaminophen only, the ingestion of watercress resulted in a significant reduction in the area under the plasma cysteine acetaminophen (Cys-acetaminophen) concentration-time curve and in the peak plasma Cys-acetaminophen concentration by 28\% +/- 3\% and by 21\% +/- 4\% (mean +/- SE; n = 7; p < 0.005), respectively. Correspondingly, the Cys-acetaminophen formation rate constant and Cys-acetaminophen formation fraction were decreased by 55\% +/- 9\% and 52\% +/- 7\% (p < 0.01), respectively. Consistent with the results obtained from the plasma, the total urinary excretion of Cys-acetaminophen in 24 hours was also reduced. A decrease of mercapturate acetaminophen, a Cys-acetaminophen metabolite, was also shown in the plasma and urine samples. However, the plasma pharmacokinetic processes and the urinary excretions of acetaminophen, acetaminophen glucuronide, and acetaminophen sulfate were not altered significantly by the watercress treatment. These results suggest that the consumption of watercress causes a decrease in the levels of oxidative metabolites of acetaminophen, probably due to inhibition of oxidative metabolism of this drug.},

  abstract =    {Panadol Extend (PEx) is an over-the-counter, modified-release formulation of paracetamol. Each 665 mg tablet contains 69\% slow-release and 31\% immediate-release paracetamol. In simulated human overdose, PEx exhibits lower and later peak serum concentrations and a lower area-under-the-curve (AUC) than comparable doses of immediate-release paracetamol (APAP-IR). The lower AUC might result from incomplete absorption of paracetamol or simultaneous metabolism with absorption.Do differences in pharmacokinetics (PK) between PEx and APAP-IR result from incomplete absorption or simultaneous absorption and metabolism of paracetamol?Cross-over study of 80 mg/kg of PEx or APAP-IR in nine volunteers. Serial plasma paracetamol, glucuronide, sulphate and cysteine metabolite estimates performed over 24 h. Peak plasma concentration (Cmax), AUC((0-∞),) time to peak concentration (Tmax) and elimination half-life (t(1/2) ) were compared.PEx exhibited significantly lower paracetamol Cmax (252.33 µmol/L vs 565.56 µmol/L, P= 0.0421), AUC((0-∞)) (2133 µmol/h/L vs 2637 µmol/h/L, P= 0.0004) and delayed Tmax (2.889 h vs 1.389 h, P= 0.0189) than APAP-IR. Sulphate metabolite PK parameters for both preparations, PEx vs APAP-IR, showed similar AUC((0-∞)) (1369 µmol/h/L vs 1089 µmol/h/L), Tmax (3.889 h vs 4.444 h), Cmax (95.889 µmol/L vs 95.889 µmol/L) and t(1/2) (3.895 h vs 3.810 h). Glucuronide metabolite concentrations revealed that PEx produced a lower Cmax (257.44 µmol/L vs 335.22 µmol/L, P= 0.0239) than APAP-IR. All other pharmacokinetic parameters were similar. Cysteine metabolite was not detected.There were minor differences between the PK parameters of the two major paracetamol metabolites of these two preparations in simulated overdose. The variability in paracetamol AUC seen between the two preparations in moderate overdose might be explained by concurrent metabolism of paracetamol during slower absorption with PEx.},

The fractional recovery of the mercapturic acid and cysteine conjugates of paracetamol was 9.3\% in the Caucasians compared with only 5.2\% and 4.4\% in the Ghanaians and Kenyans respectively (P = less than 0.0005). This probably indicates markedly reduced metabolic activation of paracetamol in the Africans. There were no ethnic differences in the sulphate conjugation of paracetamol, but the mean fractional recovery of the glucuronide conjugate in Caucasians (54\%) was significantly less than in the Africans (58\%). The sulphate conjugation of paracetamol was increased and glucuronide conjugation reduced in Caucasian females compared with males. A similar trend was seen in the Ghanaians but there were no other significant sex differences. The range of intersubject variation in the metabolic activation of paracetamol was sixty fold compared with only a three fold variation in glucuronide and sulphate conjugation. This has important implications for susceptibility to paracetamol hepatotoxicity following overdosage especially in a small subgroup showing extensive metabolic activation. These ethnic differences in paracetamol metabolism may be related to genetic or environmental factors including differences in diet and protein intake.},

Paracetamol and its metabolites (glucuronide, sulphate, cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates) were measured in serial plasma samples (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3,...,12, 24 h) and urine collections (0-24 h) by high-performance liquid chromatography.In Chinese subjects, the (mean range) peak plasma concentration of paracetamol was 23.8 mug/mL (17.9-32.3) and time to attain this peak 0.66 h (0.5-0.75). This was lower (P < 0.015) at 18.7 microg/mL (14.4-22.9) and achieved later (P < 0.033) at 1.06 h (0.5-2.0) in Caucasians. In Chinese subjects, plasma levels of glucuronide were lower, sulphate higher and cysteine conjugates significantly lower than in Caucasians (P < 0.05). Chinese subjects excreted 6\% more sulphate and 5\% less glucuronide. They also excreted significantly less mercapturic acid conjugates (P < 0.001).Chinese subjects show more rapid absorption of paracetamol, a tendency to produce less glucuronide but more sulphate conjugates and reduced production of cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates. The latter may help to protect against hepatotoxicity following paracetamol overdose.},

The urinary concentrations of unchanged paracetamol and its glucuronide, sulphate, cysteine, and mercapturic acid conjugates were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Statistically significant differences in the urinary excretion of unchanged paracetamol and the fractional urinary recovery of each conjugate between subjects from Alicante and subjects from the Basque country were not found. In both populations, an inverse relationship between glucuronide and sulphate conjugation following a bimodal frequency distribution pattern was found. In contrast to paracetamol oxidation, intersubject variation in paracetamol conjugation was negligible. The urinary excretion of unchanged paracetamol was higher in smokers than in nonsmokers. As compared with other studies, the urinary excretion of oxidation-derived paracetamol metabolites in both Spanish populations was intermediate and significantly different than that found in Caucasians from Scotland and West Africans (Ghana). This may determine a susceptibility to paracetamol hepatotoxicity following overdosage in the Spanish population.},

  abstract =    {In therapeutic doses paracetamol is a safe analgesic, but in overdosage it can cause severe hepatic necrosis. Following oral administration it is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, its systemic bioavailability being dose-dependent and ranging from 70 to 90\%. Its rate of oral absorption is predominantly dependent on the rate of gastric emptying, being delayed by food, propantheline, pethidine and diamorphine and enhanced by metoclopramide. Paracetamol is also well absorbed from the rectum. It distributes rapidly and evenly throughout most tissues and fluids and has a volume of distribution of approximately 0.9L/kg. 10 to 20\% of the drug is bound to red blood cells. Paracetamol is extensively metabolised (predominantly in the liver), the major metabolites being the sulphate and glucuronide conjugates. A minor fraction of drug is converted to a highly reactive alkylating metabolite which is inactivated with reduced glutathione and excreted in the urine as cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates. Large doses of paracetamol (overdoses) cause acute hepatic necrosis as a result of depletion of glutathione and of binding of the excess reactive metabolite to vital cell constituents. This damage can be prevented by the early administration of sulfhydryl compounds such as methionine and N-acetylcysteine. In healthy subjects 85 to 95\% of a therapeutic dose is excreted in the urine within 24 hours with about 4, 55, 30, 4 and 4\% appearing as unchanged paracetamol and its glucuronide, sulphate, mercapturic acid and cysteine conjugates, respectively. The plasma half-life in such subjects ranges from 1.9 to 2.5 hours and the total body clearance from 4.5 to 5.5 ml/kg/min. Age has little effect on the plasma half-life, which is shortened in patients taking anticonvulsants. The plasma half-life is usually normal in patients with mild chronic liver disease, but its prolonged in those with decompensated liver disease.},

Paracetamol (1000 mg) together with 300 or 150 mg nizatidine or placebo was orally administered to five healthy male volunteers. Venous blood samples were taken before and after administration. Plasma paracetamol and paracetamol conjugates (glucuronide and sulfate) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the plasma paracetamol concentration-time curves of each volunteer. The plasma nizatidine concentration was highest (2420.0+/-192.4 and 996.0+/-54.6 ng mL(-1)) in the sample taken 1 h after administration of 300 mg nizatidine (high dose) and 150mg nizatidine (low dose), respectively. Plasma paracetamol concentrations with nizatidine (high and low doses) were increased significantly at 45-120 min and 45-60 min, respectively, compared with placebo. The total area under the plasma paracetamol concentration-time curve from 0 to 180 min (2361.5+/-146.4 and 2085.75+/-73.5 microg min mL(-1)) significantly increased after coadministration of nizatidine (high and low doses), respectively (P < 0.01 vs placebo). Paracetamol glucuronide concentrations with nizatidine (high and low doses) were decreased significantly at 30-45 min and 30 min, respectively, compared with placebo. However, plasma paracetamol sulfate concentrations with nizatidine (high and low doses) were not significantly altered. The coadministration of nizatidine (150 and 300 mg) dose-dependently reduces plasma paracetamol glucuronide concentrations and increases plasma paracetamol concentrations. The effects of nizatidine could result from the inhibition of glucuronyltransferase. Thus, care is necessary when paracetamol and nizatidine are coadministered.},

  abstract =    {A range of analytical methods exist for the determination of paracetamol in biological fluids. However, to understand the fate of paracetamol and the effect of other drugs on its disposition in vivo, the major metabolites require quantification in urine and plasma. A method to simultaneously quantify paracetamol, paracetamol glucuronide (PG) and paracetamol sulphate (PS) in plasma and urine with superior sensitivity is therefore desired, especially if the volume of plasma available is low. A simple isocratic reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay with spectrophotometric detection has been developed. The method, requiring only 100 microl of plasma and 50 microl of urine, utilizes a reversed-phase C18 column, a wavelength of 254 nm for detection and a mobile phase composed of potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (0.1 M)-isopropanol-tetrahydrofuran (THF) (100:1.5:0.1, v/v/v) adjusted to pH 3.7 with phosphoric acid. The method is sensitive and linear in plasma within a concentration range from 0.4 to 200 microM for paracetamol, PG and PS. For PG and PS in urine, the method is sensitive and linear within a concentration range from 100 to 20,000 microM. Over these ranges, accuracy and precision were less than 12\%. The assay has been used to measure concentrations of paracetamol and the two metabolites in plasma collected by finger-prick sampling and of the metabolites in urine from healthy volunteers administered a single oral dose of 1000 mg of paracetamol.},

  abstract =    {Acetaminophen is the primary cause of acute liver toxicity in Europe/USA, which led the FDA to reconsider recommendations concerning safe acetaminophen dosage/use. Unfortunately, the current tests for liver toxicity are no ideal predictive markers for liver injury, i.e. they only measure acetaminophen exposure after profound liver toxicity has already occurred. Furthermore, these tests do not provide mechanistic information. Here, 'omics techniques (global analysis of metabolomic/gene-expression responses) may provide additional insight. To better understand acetaminophen-induced responses at low doses, we evaluated the effects of (sub-)therapeutic acetaminophen doses on metabolite formation and global gene-expression changes (including, for the first time, full-genome human miRNA expression changes) in blood/urine samples from healthy human volunteers. Many known and several new acetaminophen-metabolites were detected, in particular in relation to hepatotoxicity-linked, oxidative metabolism of acetaminophen. Transcriptomic changes indicated immune-modulating effects (2g dose) and oxidative stress responses (4g dose). For the first time, effects of acetaminophen on full-genome human miRNA expression have been considered and confirmed the findings on mRNA level. 'Omics techniques outperformed clinical chemistry tests and revealed novel response pathways to acetaminophen in humans. Although no definitive conclusion about potential immunotoxic effects of acetaminophen can be drawn from this study, there are clear indications that the immune system is triggered even after intake of low doses of acetaminophen. Also, oxidative stress-related gene responses, similar to those seen after high dose acetaminophen exposure, suggest the occurrence of possible pre-toxic effects of therapeutic acetaminophen doses. Possibly, these effects are related to dose-dependent increases in levels of hepatotoxicity-related metabolites.},

To better understand the kinetics of this process and to characterize the dynamic changes in metabolism and pharmacokinetics (PK) between children and adults, we developed a physiologically based PK (PBPK) model for APAP integrating in silico, in vitro, and in vivo PK data into a single model. The model was developed and qualified for adults and subsequently expanded for application in children by accounting for maturational changes from birth. Once developed and qualified, it was able to predict clinical PK data in neonates (0-28 days), infants (29 days to <2 years), children (2 to <12 years), and adolescents (12-17 years) following intravenous and orally administered APAP. This approach represents a general strategy for projecting drug exposure in children, in the absence of pediatric PK information, using previous drug- and system-specific information of adults and children through PBPK modeling.CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology (2013) 2, e80; doi:10.1038/psp.2013.55; advance online publication 16 October 2013.},

Urinary excretion of paracetamol, paracetamol glucuronide and paracetamol sulphate was also unaffected by imatinib. The pharmacokinetics of paracetamol and imatinib in Korean patients with CML were similar to previous pharmacokinetic results in white patients with CML. Co-administration of a single dose of paracetamol and multiple doses of imatinib was well tolerated and safety profiles were similar to those of either drug alone.The pharmacokinetics of paracetamol and its major metabolites in the presence of imatinib were similar to those of the control conditions and the combination was well tolerated.

For each drug, 6 healthy male volunteers were dosed with 100 μg (14)C-labelled compound. For clarithromycin, sumatriptan, and propafenone this labelled dose was administered alone, i.e. as a microdose, orally and intravenously (iv) and as an iv tracer dose concomitantly with an oral non-labelled therapeutic dose, in a 3-way cross over design. The oral therapeutic doses were 250, 50, and 150 mg, respectively. Paracetamol was given as the labelled microdose orally and iv using a 2-way cross over design, whereas phenobarbital was given only as the microdose orally. Plasma concentrations of total (14)C and parent drug were measured using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) or HPLC followed by AMS. Plasma concentrations following non-(14)C-labelled oral therapeutic doses were measured using either HPLC-electrochemical detection (clarithromycin) or HPLC-UV (sumatriptan, propafenone). For all five drugs an oral microdose predicted reasonably well the PK, including the shape of the plasma profile, following an oral therapeutic dose. For clarithromycin, sumatriptan, and propafenone, one parameter, oral bioavailability, was marginally outside of the normally acceptable 2-fold prediction interval around the mean therapeutic dose value. For clarithromycin, sumatriptan and propafenone, data obtained from an oral and iv microdose were compared within the same cohort of subjects used in the study, as well as those reported in the literature. For paracetamol (oral and iv) and phenobarbital (oral), microdose data were compared with those reported in the literature only. Where 100 μg iv (14)C-doses were given alone and with an oral non-labelled therapeutic dose, excellent accord between the PK parameters was observed indicating that the disposition kinetics of the drugs tested were unaffected by the presence of therapeutic concentrations. This observation implies that any deviation from linearity following the oral therapeutic doses occurs during the absorption process.},

  abstract =    {Many analytical methods exist for the assay of paracetamol in biological fluids, including colorimetry with chemical derivatization, direct spectrophotometry, chromatographic methods and immunoassays. Their development has been largely driven by the needs of clinical toxicology requiring the rapid, reliable and highly specific estimation of paracetamol in plasma samples to determine the need for antidote therapy. However, for in vivo metabolism studies, a specific assay method which can provide measurements of paracetamol and its metabolites in both plasma and urine is desired. A reversed-phase HPLC method with UV detection at 254 nm was developed to fulfil these requirements. The assay involves minimum sample preparation with a relatively short run time. The solvent system involves a simple isocratic elution with a composition of 0.1 M potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate-acetic acid-propan-2-ol, (100:0.1:0.75, v/v/v). The reproducibility of the assay was high with an inter-assay RSD of 0.2-1.7\% for urinary paracetamol concentrations of 5-500 micrograms ml-1 and 0.1-3.3\% for plasma concentrations between 5 and 25 micrograms ml-1. A similarly high degree of precision was found for the glucuronide, sulphate, cysteine and mercapturate metabolites of paracetamol. The same assay can be used to analyse both plasma and urine samples and thus was employed for studies on the metabolism of paracetamol in healthy subjects and in patients with various diseases.},

The direct inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities has been identified as a mechanism of potentiation of paracetamol hepatotoxicity. However, the effects of TKIs on paracetamol glucuronidation are not known.• The TKIs, sorafenib, dasatinib and imatinib exhibited potent mixed inhibition against paracetamol glucuronidation in pooled human liver microsomes, implying a possible increase in paracetamol hepatotoxicity when they are co-administrated with paracetamol. AIMS We aimed to investigate the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on paracetamol (acetaminophen) glucuronidation.The inhibition of nine small molecule TKIs on paracetamol glucuronidation was investigated in human liver microsomes (HLMs) and recombinant human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs).Sorafenib, dasatinib and imatinib exhibited mixed inhibition against paracetamol glucuronidation in pooled HLMs, and potent inhibition in UGT1A9 and UGT2B15. Dasatinib and imatinib also inhibited UGT1A1-mediated paracetamol glucuronidation. Axitinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, nilotinib and vandetanib exhibited weak inhibition of paracetamol glucuronidation activity in HLMs.The inhibition of paracetamol glucuronidation by TKIs might be of particular concern when they are co-administered.},

  abstract =    {CYP2E1, 1A2, and 3A4 have all been implicated in the formation of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), the reactive intermediate of acetaminophen (INN, paracetamol), in studies in human liver microsomes and complementary deoxyribonucleic acid-expressed enzymes. However, recent pharmacokinetic evidence in humans has shown that the involvement of CYP1A2 is negligible in vivo. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the respective roles of CYP2E1 and 3A4 in vivo.The involvement of CYP2E1 was assessed through pretreatment of adult human volunteers with disulfiram to inhibit the enzyme and the role of CYP3A4 through its induction in a second cohort of adults with rifampin (INN, rifampicin). Each of the respective studies was an open-label, balanced-randomized crossover design. Blood samples were obtained serially for 12 hours and urine was collected for 24 hours after acetaminophen administration. Acetaminophen was assayed in plasma, and acetaminophen and metabolites were assayed in urine.The recovery of the thiol metabolites formed by conjugation of NAPQI with glutathione was decreased by 69\%, and the formation clearance of NAPQI was decreased by 74\% (both P < .01) by pretreatment with disulfiram. Rifampin pretreatment had no effect on the formation of NAPQI or the recovery of thiol metabolites formed by conjugation of NAPQI with glutathione.CYP2E1 accounts for the formation of NAPQI in intact humans; the contribution of other isozymes of cytochrome P450 appears to be negligible. Under some conditions, disulfiram may be useful in diminishing the formation of NAPQI after acetaminophen overdose.},

  abstract =    {Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is extensively conjugated with glucuronic acid and sulfate prior to renal excretion. A minor metabolic route involves microsomal oxidation of acetaminophen to a hepatotoxic reactive intermediate, which subsequently undergoes glutathione (GSH) conjugation, yielding cysteine and mercapturate conjugates, both of which are excreted in the urine (Slattery et al., 1987). Data collected by de Morais et al. (1989) indicated that in comparison with normal subjects, glucuronidation of acetaminophen was impaired in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome, a genetically-based impairment of bilirubin glucuronidation. Thus, inter-subject and ethnic differences in acetaminophen disposition have pharmacogenetic and toxicological implications. This study was conceived to explore these differences. Urinary excretion of acetaminophen and its metabolites was observed in 125 Caucasian and 33 Oriental subjects. No appreciable difference was noted in the mean fraction of drug excreted as glucuronide between the two groups (51.5\% in Caucasians vs 51.8\% in Orientals). However, the data strongly indicated that the excretion of acetaminophen glucuronide was not normally distributed. Bimodality was apparent in both groups, with 20\% of Caucasian and 33\% of Oriental subjects displaying relatively extensive glucuronidation. In addition, glucuronidation displayed a strong negative correlation with sulfation (r = -0.97), suggesting the existence of a compensatory mechanism between the two metabolic pathways. The mean fractional excretions of cysteine and mercapturate conjugates did show significant differences between Caucasians and Orientals (p < 0.005). In addition, the ratio of mercapturate to total GSH-derived conjugates recovered appeared to be bimodal, indicating possible heterogeneity in the conversion of the cysteine conjugate to mercapturate via N-acetylation.},

About 55\% and 30\% of a therapeutic dose is excreted in the urine as glucuronide and sulphate conjugates, respectively, whereas mercapturic acid and cysteine conjugates (representing conversion to a potentially toxic intermediate metabolite) each account for some 4\% of the dose. Paracetamol metabolism is age- and dose-dependent. 3 With hepatotoxic doses, paracetamol metabolism is impaired and the half-life prolonged. Sulphate conjugation is saturated and the proportion excreted as mercapturic acid and cysteine conjugates is increased. 4 The renal clearance of paracetamol depends on urine flow rate by not pH. The renal clearances of the glucuronide and sulphate conjugates often exceed the glomerular filtration rate and are independent of urine flow and pH. 5 Phenacetin absorption depends on formulation. It is extensively metabolized to paracetamol and minor metabolites are probably responsible for toxicity.},

Plasma concentrations of these metabolites were even higher in the dialysis patients and there was no significant fall over 24 h.

Five healthy volunteers were administered 1000 mg of APAP orally. Five patients with chronic pain were administered the optimal oral dose of APAP ranging from 600 to 1000 mg to allow for an adequate analgesic effect. Plasma APAP and APAP metabolite concentrations were measured in the volunteers, plasma APAP concentrations and pain scores using a visual analog scale were measured in the patients with chronic pain. Patient data were fitted to a first-order absorption one-compartment model with delayed effects accounted for by an effect compartment. A sigmoid Emax model was used as the pharmacodynamic model. Acetaminophen-cysteine metabolites, which are conjugates of the toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone-imine, were detected in the plasma at levels lower than 0.2 microg/ml, but no side effects were observed. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameter (mean+/-S.D.) estimates were as follows: clearance, 18.7+/-4.7 l/h; distribution volume, 30.9+/-6.8 l; absorption rate constant, 2.4+/-1.3 h(-1); rate constant for the elimination of APAP from the effect compartment, 1.3+/-0.5 h(-1); maximum pain relief score, 4.6+/-2.2 units; effect compartment concentration at 50\% maximum, 2.0+/-1.2 microg/ml; and sigmoid factor, 1.3+/-0.7.

There are no data on Panadol Extend pharmacokinetics in overdose. It is unknown whether the paracetamol treatment nomogram can be used to make decisions regarding the toxicity of this product in overdose.To compare the pharmacokinetics of Panadol Extend and immediate-release paracetamol (APAP-IR) in simulated overdose model in healthy volunteers.Cross-over study using a dose of 90 mg/kg ideal body weight of Panadol Extend or APAP-IR in seven healthy volunteers. Serum paracetamol concentrations were measured over 12 h. Maximal paracetamol concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), area under the curve (AUC) and elimination half-life (t(1/2)) were compared.Mean paracetamol dose was 73 mg/kg actual body weight. Panadol Extend produced lower Cmax (0.208 mmol/L +/- 0.02 vs 0.48 mmol/L +/- 0.02, P = 0.0001) and AUC(0-12 h) when compared with APAP-IR. Tmax was delayed with Panadol Extend (2.83 h +/- 0.26 vs 0.94 h +/- 0.17, P = 0.0001). Absorption was complete in all subjects by 4 h post ingestion in both study arms. Elimination t(1/2) was 1.69 +/- 0.09 h for APAP-IR and 1.65 +/- 0.13 h for Panadol Extend (not significant).Reductions in Panadol Extend Cmax and AUC(0-12 h) might be related to elimination occurring during the absorption phase. In this model of Panadol Extend moderate overdose, Tmax was significantly delayed. In larger overdoses, time to peak paracetamol levels might be further delayed, because of continuing absorption from the formulation. Therefore, the paracetamol treatment nomogram might not reliably predict hepatotoxicity from Panadol Extend if paracetamol levels are measured too early.},

  abstract =    {A specific, sensitive and rapid method based on high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of paracetamol (APAP) and its glucuronide conjugate (PG) in human plasma and urine. Plasma samples were precipitated with the mixture of acetonitrile and propylene glycol (90:10, v/v) solution and urine samples were diluted with the mobile phase, which were used to isolate the analytes from biological matrices followed by injection of the extracts onto a C(18) column with isocratic elution. Detection was carried out on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using positive electrospray ionization (ESI(+)). The method was validated over the concentration range of 10-30,000 ng/mL and 100-6000 ng/mL for APAP in human plasma and urine as well as 10-15,000 ng/mL and 200-60,000 ng/mL for PG in human plasma and urine, respectively. Inter- and intra-run precisions of APAP and PG were less than 15\% and the accuracy was within 85-115\% for both plasma and urine. The average extraction recoveries were 93.1\% and 89.1\% for APAP, and 93.7\% and 92.3\% for PG in human plasma and urine, respectively. The linearity, recovery and stability were validated for APAP and PG in human plasma and urine. The method proved to be simple, robust and time efficient.},

  abstract =    {The quantification of acetaminophen (APAP) and two of its metabolites, i.e. acetaminophen-glucuronide (APAP-GLUC) and acetaminophen-cysteine (APAP-CYS), is described in human plasma using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer operating in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM/MS) mode and to a high resolution quadrupole time-of -flight mass spectrometer operating in the MS/MS (HR-SRM/MS) mode. Starting with a 50 μL plasma aliquot, a generic sample preparation was performed using protein precipitation with methanol/ethanol. Both methods were found to be linear over 2.5 orders of magnitude. Similar performances to the SRM/MS assay were obtained for APAP, APAP-CYS and APAP-GLUC using high resolution-selected reaction monitoring mode with LLOQ of 20, 50 and 50 ng/mL, respectively. For all analytes, precision was found to be better than 12\% and accuracy in the range 90.3-109\%. The present study demonstrates the ability of QqTOF platforms for accurate and precise quantification in MS/MS mode using short duty cycle with similar sensitivity to LC-SRM/MS. Additionally, as full scan data MS(ALL) are available qualitative and quantitative information on metabolites can also be obtained in a single LC-MS run.},

  abstract    = {Turmeric extract derived curcuminoids (curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin) are currently being evaluated for the treatment of cancer and Alzheimer's dementia. Previous in vitro studies indicate that curcuminoids and piperine (a black pepper derivative that enhances curcuminoid bioavailability) could inhibit human CYP3A, CYP2C9, UGT and SULT dependent drug metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine whether a commercially available curcuminoid/piperine extract alters the pharmacokinetic disposition of probe drugs for these enzymes in human volunteers.A randomized placebo-controlled six way crossover study was conducted in eight healthy volunteers. A standardized curcuminoid/piperine preparation (4 g curcuminoids plus 24 mg piperine) or matched placebo was given orally four times over 2 days before oral administration of midazolam (CYP3A probe), flurbiprofen (CYP2C9 probe) or paracetamol (acetaminophen) (dual UGT and SULT probe). Plasma and urine concentrations of drugs, metabolites and herbals were measured by HPLC. Subject sedation and electroencephalograph effects were also measured following midazolam dosing.Compared with placebo, the curcuminoid/piperine treatment produced no meaningful changes in plasma C(max), AUC, clearance, elimination half-life or metabolite levels of midazolam, flurbiprofen or paracetamol (α = 0.05, paired t-tests). There was also no effect of curcuminoid/piperine treatment on the pharmacodynamics of midazolam. Although curcuminoid and piperine concentrations were readily measured in plasma following glucuronidase/sulfatase treatment, unconjugated concentrations were consistently below the assay thresholds (0.05-0.08 μM and 0.6 μM, respectively).The results indicate that short term use of this piperine-enhanced curcuminoid preparation is unlikely to result in a clinically significant interaction involving CYP3A, CYP2C9 or the paracetamol conjugation enzymes.},

The peak plasma concentration revealed significantly higher values in women in both phases, by 48\% and 66\%, respectively. The time to reach the peak concentration was shorter by 8\% in follicular phase than in males. The difference was statistically insignificant. Elimination constant decreased in follicular phase by 15\% and in luteal phase by 21\% in comparison with males (the difference--statistically insignificant). The paracetamol half-life was longer (although not significantly) in women than in men: in follicular phase by 29 min, i.e. 15\%, and in luteal phase by 65 min, i.e. 33\%. The apparent volume of distribution was found to be significantly lower in the female group by 35\% and 40\% in follicular and luteal phase, respectively. Comparing data obtained in the follicular and luteal phase, it was shown that the AUC was larger, peak plasma concentration was higher and biological half-life was longer in luteal phase. It is likely that the differences in some pharmacokinetic parameters between men and women, as well as in women considering both phases of menstrual cycle, might be of clinical significance.},

Nineteen fit subjects (mean age 26 years), 20 fit subjects (mean age 73 years), and eight frail, hospitalized subjects (mean age 82 years) were recruited. Paracetamol clearance expressed in terms of body weight was significantly lower in the fit elderly than in the fit young subjects, and was lowest in the frail elderly subjects (p less than 0.01). There was no difference in paracetamol clearance expressed per unit volume of liver between the fit young and fit elderly subjects but it was significantly reduced in the frail subjects. Although the partial metabolic clearance to paracetamol sulphate was preserved per unit volume of liver with ageing and frailty, the partial metabolic clearance to paracetamol glucuronide per unit volume of liver was markedly reduced in the frail elderly (p less than 0.01) when compared with the fit subjects. These results show that age-associated changes in paracetamol clearance are attributable to both changes in liver volume and in general health. The findings underline the important influences of the elderly person's physical state upon drug clearance.},

However, limited studies on acetaminophen pharmacokinetics have been conducted in the native Chinese and few such data have been reported in the English language literature. Previous published studies suggested that environmental and genetic factors may cause inter-individual difference in acetaminophen disposition, thus we investigated the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen in Hong Kong Chinese subjects. A single 500 mg oral dose of acetaminophen was administered to 12 healthy male Chinese subjects under fasting conditions. Multiple blood samples were obtained after drug administration. Plasma acetaminophen concentrations were determined using HPLC, and its main pharmacokinetic parameters were generated. In comparison to other published data, acetaminophen half-life was considerably longer (15-62\%), and oral clearance was lower (16-56\%) in Hong Kong Chinese as compared to Australian Chinese, Caucasians (USA, UK, Australia), and subjects from Pakistan, Denmark, Spain and South Africa. Similarities however were found in the pharmacokinetic parameters between Hong Kong Chinese and Mainland Chinese subjects. The observed pharmacokinetic parameters of acetaminophen in Hong Kong Chinese subjects may be different from other ethnic populations. Further studies are needed to verify this hypothesis.},

  abstract =    {The principal aim of this study was to develop, validate, and demonstrate a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict and characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of acetaminophen (APAP) in humans. A PBPK model was created that included pharmacologically and toxicologically relevant tissue compartments and incorporated mechanistic descriptions of the absorption and metabolism of APAP, such as gastric emptying time, cofactor kinetics, and transporter-mediated movement of conjugated metabolites in the liver. Through the use of a hierarchical Bayesian framework, unknown model parameters were estimated using a large training set of data from human pharmacokinetic studies, resulting in parameter distributions that account for data uncertainty and inter-study variability. Predictions from the model showed good agreement to a diverse test set of data across several measures, including plasma concentrations over time, renal clearance, APAP absorption, and pharmacokinetic and exposure metrics. The utility of the model was then demonstrated through predictions of cofactor depletion, dose response of several pharmacokinetic endpoints, and the relationship between APAP biomarker levels in the plasma and those in the liver. The model addressed several limitations in previous PBPK models for APAP, and it is anticipated that it will be useful in predicting the pharmacokinetics of APAP in a number of contexts, such as extrapolating across doses, estimating internal concentrations, quantifying population variability, assessing possible impacts of drug coadministration, and, when coupled with a suitable pharmacodynamic model, predicting toxicity.},

Paracetamol clearance in females using OCS was 49% greater than in the control females. Glucuronidation and oxidative metabolism were both induced in OCS users (by 78% and 36% respectively) but sulphation was not altered.

Thirty-eight of the male volunteers were cigarette smokers, 40 of the female subjects were smokers and/or users of OCS. The metabolic ratio of sparteine oxidation (MRs) showed a trimodal distribution. 7.7% of the subjects had a MRs > 20 and thus were poor metabolizers (PMs). Within the extensive metabolizer (EM) subjects, a distinct subgroup accounting for 11% was observed with 20 > MRs > 1.2. Six of the 15 phenotypical PMs were heterozygous EMs by genotyping. This indicates the existence of one or several CYP2D6 mutations which cannot be identified by the currently employed genotyping methods. In each subgroup, i.e. smokers/OCS and non-smokers/non-OCS, the cumulative frequency distribution of the heterozygous (wt/B) phenotype caused a shift to higher MRs compared with the wild-type homozygotes (wt/wt). Thus, for the in vivo activity of CYP2D6, genetic determinants prevail over environmental factors. Smoking, use of oral contraceptive steroids, caffeine consumption, or gender had no influence on sparteine metabolism. The distribution of the paracetamol glucuronide/paracetamol metabolic ratio appeared to be unimodal although skewed. Glucuronidation capacity was clearly affected by gender, OCS use and smoking. It was higher in male than in female subjects. Male smokers had the highest, and female non-smokers/non-OCS users the lowest metabolic ratio. CYP1A2 activity, as determined by a caffeine metabolic ratio ((AFMU + 1X + 1U)/1, 7U), was multimodally distributed and was clearly increased in smokers. It was significantly correlated to paracetamol glucoronidation in male heavy smokers (r=0.85), suggesting an element of co-regulation of CYP1A2 and of paracetamol conjugating UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isozymes, including UGTI.6.},

Two of the patients required liver transplantation, whereas all the others recovered spontaneously. Peak APAP adducts correlated with peak hepatic transaminase values, time-to-treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and risk determination per the Rumack-Matthews nomogram. A population pharmacokinetic analysis (NONMEM) was performed with post hoc empiric Bayesian estimates determined for the elimination rate constants (k(e)), elimination half-lives (t(1/2)), and maximum concentration of adducts (C(max)) of the subjects. The mean (+/-SD)k(e) and half-life were 0.486 +/- 0.084 days(-1) and 1.47+/- 0.30 days, respectively, and the C(max) was 1.2 (+/-2.92) nmol/ml serum. The model-derived, predicted adduct value at 48 h (Adduct 48) correlated with adductC(max), adduct T(max), Rumack-Matthews risk determination, peak aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The pharmacokinetics and clinical correlates of APAP adducts in pediatric and adolescent patients with APAP overdose support the need for a further examination of the role of APAP adducts as clinically relevant and specific biomarkers of APAP toxicity.},

  abstract     = {Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States and mechanisms of liver injury induced by APAP overdose have been the focus of extensive investigation. Studies in the mouse model, which closely reproduces the human condition, have shown that hepatotoxicity is initiated by formation of a reactive metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which depletes cellular glutathione and forms protein adducts on mitochondrial proteins. This leads to mitochondrial oxidative and nitrosative stress, accompanied by activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and its translocation to the mitochondria. This then amplifies the mitochondrial oxidant stress, resulting in translocation of Bax and dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) to the mitochondria, which induces mitochondrial fission, and ultimately induction of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MPT). The induction of MPT triggers release of intermembrane proteins such as apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G into the cytosol and their translocation to the nucleus, causing nuclear DNA fragmentation and activation of regulated necrosis. Though these cascades of events were primarily identified in the mouse model, studies on human hepatocytes and analysis of circulating biomarkers from patients after APAP overdose, indicate that a number of mechanistic events are identical in mice and humans. Circulating biomarkers also seem to be useful in predicting the course of liver injury after APAP overdose in humans and hold promise for significant clinical use in the near future.},

  abstract        = {Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the West. In mice, APAP hepatotoxicity can be rapidly induced with a single dose. Because it is both clinically relevant and experimentally convenient, APAP intoxication has become a popular model of liver injury. Early data demonstrated that rats are resistant to APAP toxicity. As a result, mice are the preferred species for mechanistic studies. Furthermore, recent work has shown that the mechanisms of APAP toxicity in humans are similar to mice. Nevertheless, some investigators still use rats. New mechanistic information from the last forty years invites a reevaluation of the differences between these species. Comparison may provide interesting insights and confirm or exclude the rat as an option for APAP studies. To this end, we treated rats and mice with APAP and measured parameters of liver injury, APAP metabolism, oxidative stress, and activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Consistent with earlier data, we found that rats were highly resistant to APAP toxicity. Although overall APAP metabolism was similar in both species, mitochondrial protein adducts were significantly lower in rats. Accordingly, rats also had less oxidative stress. Finally, while mice showed extensive activation and mitochondrial translocation of JNK, this could not be detected in rat livers. These data support the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction is critical for the development of necrosis after APAP treatment. Because mitochondrial damage also occurs in humans, rats are not a clinically relevant species for studies of APAP hepatotoxicity.},

A total of 176 lymphoblastoid cell lines from healthy subjects were treated with increasing concentrations of NAPQI. Inhibiting concentration 50 values were determined and were associated with "glutathione pathway" gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genome-wide basal messenger RNA expression, as well as with 1.3 million genome-wide SNPs. A group of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 3 was highly associated with NAPQI toxicity. The p value for rs2880961, the SNP with the lowest p value, was 1.88 × 10(-7). This group of SNPs mapped to a "gene desert," but chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated binding of several transcription factor proteins including heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and HSF2, at or near rs2880961. These chromosome 3 SNPs were not significantly associated with variation in basal expression for any of the genome-wide genes represented on the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip. We have used a cell line-based model system to identify a SNP signal associated with NAPQI cytotoxicity. If these observations are validated in future clinical studies, this SNP signal might represent a potential biomarker for risk of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. The mechanisms responsible for this association remain unclear.},

APAP hepatotoxicity remains a global issue; in the United States, in particular, it accounts for more than 50% of overdose-related acute liver failure and approximately 20% of the liver transplant cases. The pathophysiology, disease course and management of acute liver failure secondary to APAP toxicity remain to be precisely elucidated, and adverse patient outcomes with increased morbidity and mortality continue to occur. Although APAP hepatotoxicity follows a predictable timeline of hepatic failure, its clinical presentation might vary. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy is considered as the mainstay therapy, but liver transplantation might represent a life-saving procedure for selected patients. Future research focus in this field may benefit from shifting towards obtaining antidotal knowledge at the molecular level, with focus on the underlying molecular signaling pathways.},

This group of SNPs mapped to a "gene desert," but chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated binding of several transcription factor proteins including heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and HSF2, at or near rs2880961. These chromosome 3 SNPs were not significantly associated with variation in basal expression for any of the genome-wide genes represented on the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip. We have used a cell line-based model system to identify a SNP signal associated with NAPQI cytotoxicity. If these observations are validated in future clinical studies, this SNP signal might represent a potential biomarker for risk of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. The mechanisms responsible for this association remain unclear.},

  abstract        = {Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure in Western countries. In the last four decades much progress has been made in our understanding of APAP-induced liver injury through rodent studies. However, some differences exist in the time course of injury between rodents and humans. To study the mechanism of APAP hepatotoxicity in humans, a human-relevant in vitro system is needed. Here we present evidence that the cell line HepaRG is a useful human model for the study of APAP-induced liver injury. Exposure of HepaRG cells to APAP at several concentrations resulted in glutathione depletion, APAP-protein adduct formation, mitochondrial oxidant stress and peroxynitrite formation, mitochondrial dysfunction (assessed by JC-1 fluorescence), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Importantly, the time course of LDH release resembled the increase in plasma aminotransferase activity seen in humans following APAP overdose. Based on propidium iodide uptake and cell morphology, the majority of the injury occurred within clusters of hepatocyte-like cells. The progression of injury in these cells involved mitochondrial reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen formation. APAP did not increase caspase activity above untreated control values and a pancaspase inhibitor did not protect against APAP-induced cell injury. These data suggest that key mechanistic features of APAP-induced cell death are the same in human HepaRG cells, rodent in vivo models, and primary cultured mouse hepatocytes. Thus, HepaRG cells are a useful model to study mechanisms of APAP hepatotoxicity in humans.},

  abstract        = {Fever is an inherent symptom of malaria in both adults and children. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the recommended antipyretic as it is inexpensive, widely available and has a good safety profile, but patients may not be able to take the oral drug reliably. A comparison between the pharmacokinetics of oral syrup and intramuscular paracetamol given to patients with acute falciparum malaria and high body temperature was performed. A randomized, open-label, two-treatment, crossover, pharmacokinetic study of paracetamol dosed orally and intramuscularly was conducted. Twenty-one adult patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were randomized to receive a single 600 mg dose of paracetamol either as syrup or intramuscular injection on day 0 followed by a single dose administered by the alternative route on day 1. Paracetamol plasma concentrations were quantified frequently and modelled simultaneously using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. The final population pharmacokinetic model was used for dose optimization simulations. Relationships between paracetamol concentrations with temperature and parasite half-life were investigated using linear and non-linear regression analyses. The population pharmacokinetic properties of paracetamol were best described by a two-compartment disposition model, with zero-order and first-order absorption for intramuscular and oral syrup administration, respectively. The relative bioavailability of oral syrup was 84.4 % (95 % CI 68.2-95.1 %) compared to intramuscular administration. Dosing simulations showed that 1000 mg of intramuscular or oral syrup administered six-hourly reached therapeutic steady state concentrations for antipyresis, but more favourable concentration-time profiles were achieved with a loading dose of 1500 mg, followed by a 1000 mg maintenance dose. This ensured that maximum therapeutic concentrations were reached rapidly during the first 6 h. No significant relationships between paracetamol concentrations and temperature or parasite half-life were found. Paracetamol plasma concentrations after oral syrup and intramuscular administration in patients with acute falciparum malaria were described successfully by a two-compartment disposition model. Relative oral bioavailability compared to intramuscular dosing was estimated as 84.4 % (95 % CI 68.2-95.1 %). Dosing simulations showed that a loading dose followed by six-hourly dosing intervals reduced the time delay to reach therapeutic drug levels after both routes of administration. The safety and efficacy of loading dose paracetamol antipyretic regimens now needs to be established in larger studies.},

  abstract        = {Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver toxicity occurs with formation of APAP-protein adducts. These adducts are formed by hepatic metabolism of APAP to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, which covalently binds to hepatic proteins as 3-(cystein-S-yl)-APAP adducts. Adducts are released into blood during hepatocyte lysis. We previously showed that adducts could be quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection following proteolytic hydrolysis, and that the concentration of adducts in serum of overdose patients correlated with toxicity. The following study examined the pharmacokinetic profile and clinical associations of adducts in 53 adults with acute APAP overdose resulting in acute liver failure. A population pharmacokinetic analysis using nonlinear mixed effects (statistical regression type) models was conducted; individual empiric Bayesian estimates were determined for the elimination rate constant and elimination half-life. Correlations between clinical and laboratory data were examined relative to adduct concentrations using nonparametric statistical approaches. Peak concentrations of APAP-protein adducts correlated with peak aminotransferase concentrations (r = 0.779) in adults with APAP-related acute liver failure. Adducts did not correlate with bilirubin, creatinine, and APAP concentration at admission, international normalized ratio for prothrombin time, or reported APAP dose. After N-acetylcysteine therapy, adducts exhibited first-order disappearance. The mean elimination rate constant and elimination half-life were 0.42 +/- 0.09 days(-1) and 1.72 +/- 0.34 days, respectively, and estimates from the population model were in strong agreement with these data. Adducts were detected in some patient samples 12 days post-ingestion. The persistence and specificity of APAP-protein adducts as correlates of toxicity support their use as specific biomarkers of APAP toxicity in patients with acute liver injury.},

  abstract        = {Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the most prevalent cause of drug-induced liver injury in western countries. Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the mechanisms of injury after APAP overdose in various animal models; however, the importance of these mechanisms for humans remains unclear. Here we investigated APAP hepatotoxicity using freshly isolated primary human hepatocytes (PHH) from either donor livers or liver resections. PHH were exposed to 5mM, 10mM or 20mM APAP over a period of 48 h and multiple parameters were assessed. APAP dose-dependently induced significant hepatocyte necrosis starting from 24h, which correlated with the clinical onset of human liver injury after APAP overdose. Interestingly, cellular glutathione was depleted rapidly during the first 3h. APAP also resulted in early formation of APAP-protein adducts (measured in whole cell lysate and in mitochondria) and mitochondrial dysfunction, indicated by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential after 12h. Furthermore, APAP time-dependently triggered c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in the cytosol and translocation of phospho-JNK to the mitochondria. Both co-treatment and post-treatment (3h) with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 reduced JNK activation and significantly attenuated cell death at 24h and 48h after APAP. The clinical antidote N-acetylcysteine offered almost complete protection even if administered 6h after APAP and a partial protection when given at 15 h. These data highlight important mechanistic events in APAP toxicity in PHH and indicate a critical role of JNK in the progression of injury after APAP in humans. The JNK pathway may represent a therapeutic target in the clinic.},
